1,"mostRecentVisit_review"," What a wonderful way to start the year! This was my second time back to HIGH END SPA, and we had a great time. The crowds were very low (seriously, it felt like we had the place to ourselves most of the day.) We walked right into the mineral baths, club mud, and didn't wait in any kind of line for lunch. None of the pools were crowded, and we were even able to enjoy one of the hammocks in the secret garden.

Tiffany at the front check-in desk went above and beyond for us regarding the robes. I had requested a plus-sized robe, since after my last review I knew they had added some to their collection. Unfortunately, all of their plus-sized robes were still dirty from the day before. Tiffany was so accommodating, though! She was able to get us robes from the cabana area that fit me perfectly! It is so great to know that not only do they now offer guests of all sizes the option to enjoy a warm robe, but that they really want to make sure you have a good day. Thank you, Tiffany, for everything.

All of the staff today were in good spirits. The only thing that would have made today better would have been a massage. We'll have to book one next time. My husband and I are going to make HIGH END SPA our annual New Year's Day tradition!

5/8/2018Hi Raven, thank you for taking the time to write a review of your recent visit. I am sorry to hear about your incident in the bath house at the end of your visit.

We take our guest comments very seriously because guest comments, good and bad, help us to learn and grow. A guest who makes the commitment to reach out and tell us what was not perfect is invaluable to our company. Always feel free to contact me regarding any of your visits or if you ever have any questions or comments.

1/8/2018Hello Laura I?m sorry to hear of your experience. Our staff understood when you called that you were canceling a service for later that same day. We do have a same day cancel (less than 24 hours notice) fee for massage appointments and all patients are notified of this in our financial policies paperwork and required to initial understanding of the policy. We understand that unfortunate circumstances can arise from time to time, which is why we waive 1 same day cancellation in a 12 month period at ?no charge?.  

You are correct that there is no charge to cancel or reschedule with advanced notice (more than 24 hours). We have reached out to you a couple of times since Saturday and look forward to clearing this up with you. Our staff has been counseled on how to avoid this type of miscommunication in the future.

I have been coming here for about a year now and see Bertha (who is amazing!). Today I had to call to cancel my appointment and reschedule. Well well... beware of a $25 cancellation fee that was never discussed with me beforehand.  I am in the health care industry and have NEVER charged a patient or costumer (more so one who has been in the practice for some time). Love Bertha, but this front office team needs a lesson in costumer service. Unfortunately will not be coming back.

Best regards, Alexa Gallegos, HIGH END SPA Hot Springs","5/7/2018Previous review
It's too bad, I had such a great time here and some bathroom attendant ruined my whole experience!! Just the worst manners and let's just say customer service was not her specialty or even close.
This young girl had some nerve to correct a customer for accidentally missing the trash with some paper from a cinco de mayo mustache.. (jokes) she chases after me to tell me to throw it in the trash I explained half way down the hall I was sorry and had to
LeAve, my friend was sick and need me to tend to her. She then chased me down again and started to harass me to tell her where my friend threw up. Really? Well, maybe she had a bad day.. but after explaining what happen to management and the front office,  Jose, the manager, didn't look too surprised.. I guess this is normal behavior for her.. needless to say I'm almost afraid to go back. I may not hold my tongue next time.. personal space was not In her vocabulary she tapped me on the shoulder, she's lucky i was in a great mood till then..

Another fabulous trip to HIGH END SPA! Love the new addition in the back with rocking chairs under beautiful trees! This place is growing faster than it can hardly keep up with - went on a Monday thinking it won't be as crowded and wow! It felt like a weekend! I'm hoping they will expand kitchen and help as it takes about 40 minutes to wait in line around the lunch hour to get food. It's all prepared fresh though and I appreciate that.

Been going here for over 27 years. I've seen all the growth and change. It's been bumpy and they are ironing out the kinks. Love the new bar - prob could use another one on other end of spa. I understand they are talking expansion though and even building a resort. I only hope it doesn't take away the private feel of this place. The area inside Starbucks (long hallway) seems like wasted space. Hardly anyone in there. Food was good, try the fish tacos (although I think they told me shells were gluten free and I'm certain they are not) and so were the beverages. Overall a relaxing day and I'd recommend if you want to get away. Get there early to claim a spot- it can get crowded and they do hit max occupancy on holidays and some weekends. Get on email list to purchase gift card deals when they offer them- it's definitely the way to go and they don't expire I'm told.

13,"mostRecentVisit_review","  My boyfriend took me here for my birthday this past weekend and it was absolutely divine. We got a canopy (Palm date one) - perfect for two and in the corner of a small jacuzzi. To start our morning at After a tasteful breakfast, we had an appointment for a massage at We then headed over to our canopy to relax and get ready to take a dip in the salt baths and mud baths. One star off for the crowd. We went on a Saturday in January and I was just taken aback by how many people there were in the pools and just in general. It takes away from the experience for me since I'm there to get away from people and relax but there was just so many people in the way. I really enjoyed the mud bath and took advantage of it and exfoliated my entire body including my face! There is a sauna room to stay in after you put the mud all over your body and then a shower you can wash the mud off at afterwards. They provide you with a ary eucalyptus body wash which smells heavenly!

Our second scheduled service was the grotto which is an underground cave experience where they paint you with a mixture of coconut oil, Shea butter, lavender & eucalyptus oil and aloe Vera! You then can hang out for as long as you like then take a shower underground too. There are complementary tea and fruits in the last room after you clean off. I think this service is an added $This experience left us hungry so we head back o our canopy and ordered the bbq chicken flat bread! So delicious :)

Finally, to end our day.. we soaked in the mineral baths and had our last scheduled service: facials. Ahhh my favorite guilty pleasure. I get facials on a monthly basis so I know what is good or not. Unfortunately I did not enjoy my facial here. They use gloves and barely do any extractions. The effort and pressure just wasn't there. Everything was mediocre including the ambiance of the room. Lights were too bright so it did not provide a comfortable experience. I had to ask the lady to dim the lights. At the end of the facial, she put tinted moisturizer on me but it was so uneven and she blamed it on the dim lighting.. she had to take it off and just put on clear spf for me. It was the worse facial I gotten. To top it off, they try to upsell you on products after which is annoying. I would not use this service again if I were to return.

Overall it was a fun, relaxing time! It flew by sooo quickly. Next time I will try to just stay at my canopy more and go to all the different pools. I would skip out on the grotto and the facial and just get a massage :)

2/7/2019Hi Kim, We're so glad you enjoyed your birthday with us. It sounds like you were here right before we closed the Grotto for renovations. It will re-open in early March and the service will be priced at $30 per person. We've passed your comments on the facial on to our skin care team. Thank you again for taking the time to write and we're looking forward to seeing  you again soon.

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday this past weekend and it was absolutely divine. We got a canopy (Palm date one) - perfect for two and in the corner of a small jacuzzi. To start our morning at 9am, we ordered the superfood omelette which is all veggies including kale, shirtsleeves, mushrooms and avocados. It was surprisingly really delicious and a great way to start our morning.

After a tasteful breakfast, we had an appointment for a massage at 10. Oh my gosh, BEST massage ever! I get a lot of massages and hands down, the massages here are magical. I believe I got Cheri who was very knowledgeable and educated me on different types of stretches for back pain, and taught me where the pressure points were. I wish it was longer but my boyfriend only booked the 50 min one. Next time, I hope to get one for at least two hours! My boyfriend really enjoyed his too.

We then headed over to our canopy to relax and get ready to take a dip in the salt baths and mud baths. One star off for the crowd. We went on a Saturday in January and I was just taken aback by how many people there were in the pools and just in general. It takes away from the experience for me since I'm there to get away from people and relax but there was just so many people in the way. I really enjoyed the mud bath and took advantage of it and exfoliated my entire body including my face! There is a sauna room to stay in after you put the mud all over your body and then a shower you can wash the mud off at afterwards. They provide you with a ary eucalyptus body wash which smells heavenly!

Our second scheduled service was the grotto which is an underground cave experience where they paint you with a mixture of coconut oil, Shea butter, lavender & eucalyptus oil and aloe Vera! You then can hang out for as long as you like then take a shower underground too. There are complementary tea and fruits in the last room after you clean off. I think this service is an added $175/ person which is pricey for what you get but it's worth trying once and one time only. My skin did feel very moisturized after.

This experience left us hungry so we head back o our canopy and ordered the bbq chicken flat bread! So delicious :)

Finally, to end our day.. we soaked in the mineral baths and had our last scheduled service: facials. Ahhh my favorite guilty pleasure. I get facials on a monthly basis so I know what is good or not. Unfortunately I did not enjoy my facial here. They use gloves and barely do any extractions. The effort and pressure just wasn't there. Everything was mediocre including the ambiance of the room. Lights were too bright so it did not provide a comfortable experience. I had to ask the lady to dim the lights. At the end of the facial, she put tinted moisturizer on me but it was so uneven and she blamed it on the dim lighting.. she had to take it off and just put on clear spf for me.

I was excited to spend the day at HIGH END SPA and expected to hear Warm water greetings of ""Good morning, thank you for choosing HIGH END SPA, on behalf of our staff, we hope you enjoy your day here.""

That greeting was never heard, ever. I initially reserved and paid for the BambooCabana for 8-10ppl @($400/day). Unfortunately HIGH END SPA couldn't get that for us because we changed dates but asked if we wanted 2 poolside cabana ($200/per cabana= same cost).  Totally fine .. just as long we can be together. I was totally upfront with the guest list indicating all guest-- not trying to cheat the system at all. Well, upon arriving we were told that we can't do a lot of things ""we won't serve people in your party that exceeds the cabanas (4ppl) and you can't step into the cabana area"".

I tried to explain to Robert the email exchanges of what was told to me, but he was not going to hear anything I said.

The group spend most of the time lounging in different pools so cabanas were used only as a quick stop to eat, drink and getting out of the sun.

At 5pm, a lot of people left and the day was getting quieter. We wanted to try the evening menu and ordered from a different server My, who proceeded to count heads in the cabana. We were told that we couldn't sit on an empty lounge chair in front of the 3rd cabana (that was mistakenly assigned to us earlier in the day--no one ever showed up/ it was zipped closed). My sister was told that she couldn't even sit on the edge of a lounge chair just to get out of the sun. The whole area was EMPTY. Are you kidding?! Robert came out reading the riot act saying that he could charge me another $200 for the day because my sister was sitting on the edge of the lounge chair in an area that was EMPTY. He reminded me that he had all our cards on file and that he could call security to have us removed.

I'll start with the Pro since it's short. The Club Mud was cool.

The rest are cons. Remember that I'm here on a weekday in the off season.
- the grotto is $30 extra
- crap nachos to share are $30, drinks $15/drink and are pre mixed, weak
- the mineral baths are very small and are absolutely packed (again, on the off-season, on a weekday)
- the mini pools were all super packed by 11am as well
- we were told to make a reservation and pre pay so we did. Guess what, you wait in line anyway! The line is akin to a Vegas nightclub. They even section off the line and ""allow"" people to check in only as they see others leave. It's insane.
- after you check in you go to the bathhouse and change, which is so inefficiently setup all the girls flow in and out of the same tiny doorway. Non stop traffic jam.
- you then are told to put a credit card of file for drinks. Fine. But then they tell you to go to yet another location, carrying your DL, to get a wristband to go to yet another location to actually get a drink. All while having to carry your drivers license around a water park. So stupid. All this could be solved at checkin checking IDs and giving wrist bands.
- overall the entire thing is akin to a water park. Maps everywhere. Extremely loud and packed. Nowhere to relax and unwind.

2,"mostRecentVisit_review"," My sister and I brought my mom here for her birthday and overall, we really enjoyed our time here. We're used to going to Korean spas, but this was definitely an upgrade.

PROS:
- The resort itself is beautiful and so relaxing. Like seriously such a pleasing escape from reality that I needed. It's set up so nicely and feels very luxurious.
- It was my mom's birthday so she received free admission on birthday with a purchase of a service. Admission is $52, so she booked a manicure for $50 and got in for free. WORTH. My mom had gone 52 years without ever getting her nails done, so it was kind of heartwarming to see how much she loved her experience.
- The three of us took a Yin Yoga class and really enjoyed it. We definitely want to take advantage of the other class options next time we come.
- CLUB MUD. We had so much fun there and even made a little clay sculpture. It really does do wonders for your skin, and the area is suprisingly very well-kept.
- The shower and locker facilities can get pretty crowded, but overall, they are super nice and clean. They have an ample amount of showers, so we didn't have to wait at all.
- All the staff seemed really friendly and helpful. There's always staff members roaming around, so you always feel somewhat taken care of.
- I really appreciated the towel and water stands located throughout the resort. So handy and necessary.
- Parking is free, thank God.

CONS:
- We went on a fairly cold day (around 60 degrees), so the hot pools were CROWDED,. Like there were a couple of times I touched other people's body parts I definitely did not want to touch. I feel like some of the hot pools exceeded capacity, and I'm sure it was mostly because it was a cold day, but I do wish there were more of the hot pools or they should just be larger!
- The food is incredibly expensive. Like as ridiculous as Disneyland, which is saying something. Plan to spend around $20 per meal per person. The one thing that was worth it was the nachos ($16 for the small, but this thing is huge).
- The kitchen moves VERY SLOWLY. Especially the salad section because I came before the lunch rush and still waited 20 minutes to order my salad. The kitchen staff seems a bit incompetent, or maybe it's just run inefficiently.
- This is more of a side note, but I wish there was a more streamlined reservation system. I made the entire reservation over the phone, which was fine, but it wasn't laid out as clearly as I would have liked it with the premium admissions prices, services, etc. The online one also just seemed really confusing.

Overall, we had a positive experience with just a couple of kinks here and there. We love that there's just a lot to do here and time FLIES when you're here so come as early as you can. We definitely want to try coming back in the summer months when it's warmer!

If you bring your own bags, they give you 6 cents per bag off of your purchase! They also advertise their prices, along with their competitors' prices, in store so you don't have to wonder if you could get an item cheaper elsewhere. Plus, they accept manufacture's coupons, so bring them in!

1. I think they just committed a HIPAA violation as to disclosing my insurance company and personal information I will check with HIPAA on Monday. I am asking now that you delete all my personal information from your system
2. I always was in pain and needed to go and called days prior and even filled out the paperwork online before hand and asked about my insurance at time of booking.
3. I have in my age been to plenty of Chiro docs and EVERY single one has called and verified insurance and copay amount as I was checking in or before. I don't think I should have to ask over and over while sitting there in treatment room to find out after asking about 5 times that you are charge a set price, that alone should of been told to me the first time I asked.

6/2/2017Mike, my name is , owner and I am very sorry for your experience at our office.  It's our practice to charge our cash fee for all patients on their first visit until we can verify the specific insurance coverage.  Our cash fee for the 1st visit is $40. It's not our practice to take someone's ""word for it"" when it comes to specific amounts of deductible or co-pays.  I know your specific case because although I wasn't treating patients when you were here, I was here and was made aware of your situation.  Specifically with your insurance, we enter your information into their system and they fax us back your specific benefits within 72 business hours. This is not our practice but rather your insurance practice.  It's the same process for all patients with your insurance.

We do typically charge $40 and ALWAYS refund back the difference if the copay or deductible is less than that amount.  I must apologize if this was not explained in detail when you scheduled your appointment.  Most patients do not have an issue with this or if they do, they will typically ask us to verify insurance prior to their 1st visit.  Many of the patients that we see are in a lot of pain and choose not to wait an additional 3 days to schedule an appointment while this particular insurance is being verified.  

I was here when this occurred and it was brought to my attention.  I told the lady that was helping you to honor your word about the amount of your copay but at that point, I think you were too upset and refused care.  

I do not like to respond to these publicly, EXCEPT when we are accused of being crooks when I can assure you that we would not have been in business for 10 years at this location as crooks.  I sincerely apologize for your experience and apologize that our policy was not communicated with you more clearly prior to your visit.","6/2/2017

5. Beware people never be seen by a doctor or dentist without them verifing your insurance and coverage. you can find out later its not covered or they dont except your type of insurance and be on the hook for thousands of dollars.. How many people in this word have been told ""Oh don't worry it will be fine"" to get messed over.

224,"mostRecentVisit_review"," Just wanted to update my review to reflect my latest experience at the spa. It was my friends birthday today and she received ary admission for the day :) it was a rainy day at the spa but that did not take away from the experience at all. If anything, it made us appreciate all the hot pools even more :) I'm gonna break it down as simply as I can:

Had an amazing massage by Ricardo: +1!
Margaritas are strong and seemingly bottomless: +1!
Food at the main restaurant was yummy: +1!
The floating bean bags in the lounging pool! Omg that was the best. You can totally set your drinks on the floating loungers too and they won't sink: +1!
Free parking: +The biggest negative that sort of put a slight damper to my day was my run in with a security guard first thing in the morning when I got there.

Some backstory:
So I always back in to whatever spot I'm parking in unless there are signs in the lot that say ""head in only""

There are no such signs at HIGH END SPAn , so I went ahead and did my thing

The security guy walks literal circles around my car and gives me the eye and looks me over

Then he stopped in front of me and asks ""why are you parked like that????""

Mind you, there are cars all over the lot that are parked head in, head out, all sorts of directions. But he singled me out and is like ""you can't park like this. It's wrong. And it isn't allowed.""

I kindly mentioned that there aren't any signs advising against how I parked and pointed at another car parked like mine and asked him, ""you mean that guy can't park like that either then right? Because he backed into his spot too.""

He looked at the cars and was like ""no no, they are okay. That is fine but you cannot park like this. Fix it""

....that was a bit disappointing tbh. So for that unfortunate run in, I'd have to subtract a star. I've included photos of how other cars were parked

This place is absolutely awesome!!  We never had a grocery store as simple and ranging in value and selection back home.  I love the dispensing area for all the seeds,  nuts,  grains and candy.  Excellent meat selection.  Everything we need at really great prices!

He clearly did not look at my file!! Then he began to do his job but did nothing we spoke about in the first appointment. I reality he had no clue who I was or Didn't even remember me.

LOW COST GROCERY STORE was very different than I expected. I was pleasantly surprised by their huge variety of ""bulk"" food.

The facial was thorough with a massage of the neck, shoulders, and arms. My skin glowed and my eyes were refreshed with the added eye soothing treatment.

My brother and sister explained to me that this place was as close to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory as any of us would ever get (which I could have done without hearing, to be honest, because that book/movie creeps me the hell out).

These assertions filled me with a weird sense of dread, as I feared I could not possibly be as impressed with any grocery store as my family so desperately wanted me to be. In fact, I thought that their weird championing of this place was a little on the off putting side. Sounded like koolaid drinking talk.

Anyway, no. This place is pretty neat. They sell things that you would never find at other similarly sized stores in a million years. Well, I guess I can't say that for sure, but I can certainly postulate. In any case, they carry all sorts of awesome stuff. They sell shredded tilamook cheese, for heaven's sake! Usually I have to shred it by hand, and who has time for that? I do, usually. But that's not the point. Furthermore, any incarnation of an item that takes the manual labor out of my hands is my favorite incarnation of that item.

Also, we ordered a couple sandwich trays for my brother's baby shower from here, and the woman in the deli was helpful and friendly.

Usually I have to shred it by hand, and who has time for that? I do, usually. But that's not the point. Furthermore, any incarnation of an item that takes the manual labor out of my hands is my favorite incarnation of that item.

Also, we ordered a couple sandwich trays for my brother's baby shower from here, and the woman in the deli was helpful and friendly. The sandwiches themselves were actually surprisingly good, and a big hit at the party. I gutted a couple of them just for the pretzel bread... Which I'm sad to think of now, because I don't have any. But I should have some. And so should you.

Happy to finally get a store open 24 hours, as many of us want to avoid the masses during normal business hours.  Was impressed with the better-than-expected selection, particularly with the massive array of bulk bins for candy, pasta, spices and even doggie treats.

Many items were similar in price to nearby Stater Brothers and there were no bargains in the meat selection (why no filet mignon?  Not all of us who shop there want lesser cuts like sirloin or skirt steak).  Other items like bread, veggies, candy, spices, etc. can be up to $1 cheaper than you will find at other major grocery stores.

I did take advantage of their amazing turkey sale on Thanksgiving at only 25 cents per pound and bought several of them to give away to the less fortunate.

All the workers I have encountered on my 2 recent visits were super helpful and friendly...perhaps because it is an Employee Owned company.

My only issues are as s:

1. Really difficult navigating the isles around midnight when they are busy restocking the shelves,with stock and empty boxes everywhere you try to move your cart.....AND, some isles closed down entirely with forklifts in operation there).

2.  NO Credit Cars accepted!! That is just plain crazy, as most high volume operations of that nature only have to pay 1% to VISA or MasterCard.

Now that everyone is comfortable in their surroundings they make you feel as if you are in their way or interrupting their time by doing things like checking out or picking out some produce.","Low","grocery store","Corona, CA",13,24,2,NA,"jamie g.","2014-06-22",NA,NA,"Sun",4,0,2,0,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0.037,0,0.019,0,0.009,0.009,0,0.028,0,0,0,0,7,5,"5","5",0,"rating 3"

They even sell lamb. Lamb shanks at regular price of $ As ers noted, a  large variety of candy, pasta, flour, cereals, rice, etc. etc.  - you name it - sold in bins.

Huge selection of produce, meats, breads - more so then at any regular area supermarket. and all very reasonably priced.  All the produce and meat looked fresh.
They even sell lamb. Lamb shanks at regular price of $ 3.99/lb. from lamb raised in the US, i.e. USDA inspected.

As previous reviewers noted, a  large variety of candy, pasta, flour, cereals, rice, etc. etc.  - you name it - sold in bins.

Noted with interest:

They sell whole prepared chickens for $ 4.99 - so, cheaper then any other  area supermarkets;

Different vinegars/oils/barbecue sauce//spaghetti sauce/ketchup  - big selection - and at prices last seen in regular supermarkets many years ago;

Some canned items - things i buy -  tuna ($ .79) , water chestnuts ($ .79), mushrooms ($ .68) - bargains!

The wedges and little boxes of Brie cheese - my favorite cheese - each at least $ 2.00 less then at area supermarkets. Other cheese varieties, sliced/chunk and grated (parmesan) - very reasonable as well.

And sometimes it is the little things one notes. Their egg cartons, again lesser priced then at area supermarkets, are stacked in such a way that the expiration date is displayed and immediate to see. The egg cartons tonight had expiration dates of 10 days plus from today, not always so in area supermarkets.

Added bonus - they are open 24 hours.

Their customer service is impeccable. I got there around 5:30 pm tonight, the height of shopping hours, and stayed for a good 50 minutes. Employees were there walking in aisles and departments throughout the store and approached customers incl. myself immediately, offering to help,  if it looked like anyone was searching for something. When was the last time that happened in a local supermarket??

This is the first spa in SoCal that I've been to and I'm not sure what the hype is about... maybe I'm just not a spa person.

You pay general admission ~$55, which gives you access to the general areas e.g. hot and cold pools, mud bath, etc. You pay $100+ extra for massages on-site, which is somewhat comparable in price to other massage places, but not so much in quality. The food is pricey and you can't bring any food in. And all robes and slippers cost extra.

This review is long overdue. Our very first visit was   9/16/16, after many friends and coworkers recommended this place. Our most recent visits took place on 03/08/2020  & 03/09/2020

On 09/16/16, my fianc and I decided to treat ourselves to some pampering & relaxation. In celebration of our anniversary, we reserved the Date Palm Cabaa, which at the time cost $200. The cabana rental included reserved parking and access to a semi-private pool, We also booked the Cabana Celebration package for $150 per person (plus an additional $60 upgrade for 80 minute services) and included our services, the admission, robe rental and the activities for the day. The services we received were the Detox Body Treatment, for myself and the Gentleman's Body, for my partner.

Upon arriving at our cabana, there was a fruit basket waiting for us. Overall, the cabana seemed clean, but it had a cushiony double-lounger that sadly looked very dingy, as if not properly cared for. Our individual services were okay. It was a very busy day, yet we felt like we could have done without the cabana. This visit was during their high season; therefore, the hours were longer so we got to enjoy more of the spa.

We returned on 03/08/2020, for a couple's day. This time we reserved 2  Loungers, instead of the cabana. We booked their ""It Takes Two"" deal, which includes: (2) Taking the Waters admission, (2) 50 minute services (each valued at $115 each,) (2) Grotto Treatments, (2) Robe rentals, (2) Breakfasts and freshly squeezed orange juice from the  Kitchen. (For the breakfast, we were given a voucher, at the time of check-in.) Total for the package was $458. We booked the Aromasoul Massage, for each of us. I must admit that I got lost on my way to the massage villa, thankfully one of the staff members was kind enough to walk me there. So I was about 5 minutes late, which cut my massage short. I also had a pedicure, which I paid $10 extra to get the better quality ""fast drying nail polish."" I like the cleanliness of the salon & the measures they take to sanitize their tools and prevent exposure to unnecessary infections. For example: all of their nail and foot files are peel on, this way none of these are reused.

On 03/09/20, I returned to the spa, after being invited for an all girl's visit. For this visit, we booked the Healthy Balance Package which consists of: (1) Taking the Waters admission, (1) 50 minute service (valued at $115,) (1) Moisturizing Grotto treatment, (1) Fresh pressed juice from The Chill Zone. (It wasn't after we had left the spa that I realized that I was never given instructions and/or the voucher for the orange juice.) Total for this package was $215. Additionally, I booked a $125 Illuminating Solution facial, and added the Hand & Foot Soother Enhancement, for an extra $25. (I would not recommend the latter, it really isn't anything you can't do at home with body scrub and hand lotion.) I had the warm stone massage, which I LOVED.  However, this time the masseuse was late, and she cut my session short.

After my facial was done, I noticed that the nail polish on all of my left toenails was chipping away. I asked about this in the salon and they assured me that the polish is suppose to last a few weeks. WEEKS, not hours. They reapplied nail polish, at no extra cost, but didn't reapply to all my toenails. On 03/12/20 a good chunk of the nail polish from my big right toe, chipped off. I am beyond disappointed, as I expected way more from an $80+ pedicure. I have paid $20 for a pedi at my local mom & pop salon and it has lasted weeks.

Overall, we enjoyed our visits; however, I don't believe the services we received were up to par with the price tag and the hype.

My sweet boyfriend surprised me with a spa day. He bought the BETTER WITH FRIENDS package that includes: Taking the Waters admission, 50-minute services, HIGH END SPA Robe rentals, and Breakfasts and freshly squeezed orange juice from the  Kitchen all for two people. It truly was the perfect day for two. Since he paid a whopping **$398** (Saturday and Sunday price) to treat me, of course I chose him to experience it with me. It was our first time at HIGH END SPA Hot Springs. He planned the entire day for us which included 10am aroma massages ing breakfast. BTW, the breakfast voucher cannot be redeemed past 11am.

We had arrived before doors opened at 9am Sunday morning. As we sat in our car, we watched a line forming in the winter cold. We decided to stand in line before it got super bad. Not sure whyyy but it takes about 15-20 minutes to get in. Staff makes every group stop and wait to ask if they have a reservation and conduct bag checks. You will probably NOT be allowed in without one.  Once you're in, the helpful staff behind the counter answer your questions and give you a map to the FREEEE lockers which is located at the same place you will be given and return your robe rentals. (My rental robe had a hole in it.) Front desk/check-in woman circled on the map where the kitchen is for breakfast and where to go for our massages.

10am massage appointment means they want you to check in around 9:45am to give you enough time to fill out a questionnaire and use the bathroom if you need to. Considering that we spent most of the 9 o'clock hour trying to check-in and walk over to the kitchen, that only gave us 20-25 minutes to order and eat breakfast. WORST PART: We were informed that they were out of orange juice!! Who knows how they were making mimosas  ?\_(?)_/?

That massage though! Heidi was absolutely lovely. Very skilled and I had the best massage. Thank you, Heidi!! PRO TIP: When you book your massage, request to be in the same village (building) as your friend/significant other. Not like it makes much of a difference since you'll be in different rooms, but I had to walk further to village #2 LOL.

I came here with a group of girls for a bachelorette get away earlier this month. I was worried that it might be a bit cold to enjoy all the pools but it was actually very nice. From reading previous reviews I can tell there is a big difference from winter to summer as far as being too crowded and being able to enjoy the facilities. I was told that there was only 300 people on the day that we went the and maximum capacity (which it reaches in the summertime) is 1,000 guests.  As it was with 300 people, the mineral pools were hard to get into as they were always full. A lot of the pool areas seemed full but not over crowded. With 700 more people, it wouldn't be fun for me.

I don't think this spa day experience is worth the arm and leg you pay to get in. Maybe I had higher expectations, but when it ends up being about $Here's my view on HIGH END SPAn ...
- First off, the website is absolutely frustrating, and extremely difficult to book a reservation. It kept kicking me out and deleting my shopping cart. After trying several different times over a 2 day period I finally decided to give up and just call them.
- If you buy a gift card online, they either mail it to you, or have it waiting U for you at the register when you get there. This is annoying if you want to buy it as a gift for someone last minute. It's 2020 and they should really look into an E-gift card or something.
- They usually have offers where you can buy a gift card and get $20 off, which is what I recommend doing.
- I was able to buy the gift card over the phone, and she was able to apply my gift card to our reservation fees which was nice.
- They make you buy an extra service if you want to reserve your admission spot. So basically if you don't buy the extra service, you are risking not being able to get in.
- We ended up choosing the Grotto Service which is $30 per person, on top of the admission fee. So it ends up being about $100 per person just to get in. Also, be aware that you have to select a specific time frame before you make your reservation. IMPORTANT** I recommend doing the grotto at the end of the day, because once they put the clay on you, they say you shouldn't go in the mud or the spa for 45 minutes. ***
- Honestly, after the whole reservation experience, I was already turned off at that point.
- I also booked a mani/pedi for my cousin since we came here to celebrate her bridal shower. ** Please do not waste your money on a nail service here! ** Holy crap this was by far the WORST mani/pedi I have ever seen. I can't even believe they get away with this. She literally had nail polish left around her skin! We were furious because it was $65 for the shellac mani, and $60 for the pedi, plus a tip. Which is an insane up charge compared to your typical nail salon! And it wasn't even a good job.
- The grotto experience was pretty cool, and the clay that they rub on you feels amazing, but if you don't like saunas, then you might not want to try it. They recommend sitting in the sauna room for about 20 minutes but I was only able to do 5. They have a bunch of showers in the cave so that was nice to rinse off after.
- **Warning**, you have to fill out a waiver and answer afew health questions before you go in, and the employee reviews them, and gives you tips before you enter. They are not at all cautious about keeping your medical info private! My cousin made a note on her waiver that she was Overall, I just felt like all the spas and pools here were just pretty average. Nothing super exciting. It felt like you were at an adult water park, but I didn't get a ""luxury"" feeling at all. Also, the food here was horrible, and WAY over priced. It's also a bummer that they don't let you bring your own food. Make sure to bring a robe, flip flops, and a hydroflask so that you don't have to keep refilling your water cup.

My cousin made a note on her waiver that she was 5 weeks pregnant, and none of us knew because she was trying to keep it a secret. The employee yelled out ""Who's Emily?"", and then proceeded to say ""Since you're 5 weeks pregnant I recommend only doing 5 minutes in the sauna"", and my cousin just gave her the look of death because she announced it to our whole group. The employee continued with ""Oh my gosh did I ruin the surprise?! I'm so sorry! This is the 2nd time this has happened!"". And then she asked us if we have any recommendations on how she can help keep info like this private. Are you serious!? HIGH END SPAn  should really have a better training plan on this since this is a pretty common thing.

Had a great first impression right off the bat. Emailed them at 7a in the morning, got a respinse from the doc within an hour, and got a phone call from the front desk before they even opened for the day. They got me in that day for an appointment which was a Godsend due to the terrible pain I was in.
Very clean, nicely furnished, good parking, convenient location, nice staff, warm and personable docs, effective treatment.
I wish I had come in sooner for my pain since I had a huge improvement just the ing day. Had to do a fake bow to the doc at my  up appointment since I was so thankful.
The doc was very effective with the treatment. I googled and YouTubed some stuff when I got home and they said to do the exact same stuff that the doc did. (Not that I didn't trust the doc, but I like to take my health into my own hands too and be as educated as possible).
The consultation and x rays were very informative and eye opening. I had no idea that I had a bulging disc in my lower back and early stages of arthritis!!! Now I can be more proactive at protecting my wellbeing before I become a crippled and pained person later on.

I've been wanting to come here for years and finally got to do so with my hubby last week. We decided to go during their twilight hours, which is from 4-9pm and has live entertainment. Walk-ins are not permitted once they reach capacity, so I suggest buying one of their services to guarantee entry. Luckily, we made reservations for the grotto moisturizing treatment!

If you only pay for admission, which is referred to ""taking the waters"" this just gives you access to their 19 pools, club mud, and lounge areas. Anything else you want to book like massages, facials, are an extra cost.

We got there early and couldn't go inside until it was 4pm- by then, there was already a long line outside, but it moved fairly quickly. After checking in, we were given a map and tips on what to do since it was both our first time at HIGH END SPA.

They suggested changing into our beach attire and soaking in the mineral waters before heading to club mud. Club mud is where you slather red clay all over your wet skin. You can wait for it to dry in the Wafa cave and/or by the sun. After the clay dries up, we rinsed ourselves off and it was time to go to our grotto appointment.

We already signed the waivers ahead of time, so we only waited about 10 minutes before it was time to descend to a secret cave. This was where an employee painted us from neck-to-toe with a warm aloe vera, coconut oil, eucalyptus, shea butter, and lavender masque. They gave us extra formula to put over our faces or anywhere we wanted to add the extra masque. Then we sat in a heated cavern to open up our pores. When it got too hot, we rinsed ourselves off and then sat in a cooler grotto to relax with tea, water and green apples. My skin was super soft afterwards!

I was seriously considering getting a yearly pass so I can do the yoga, Club Mud and the Grotto during the year and am going to pass because the yoga is not that great.  I hope they get another yoga instructor soon.  

The food, is good quality and typical spa type food. You also get a good amount of food to each order.  Their drinks are good as well.   The price for the drinks and food is pricey, but it's the spa, so it's expected to be overpriced.

You can spend a lot of money on services, entrance fee, and food here in a day. I splurged here for my mom's 60th and she had a great time so for that, it was worth it. I wouldn't spend a day here with services on myself, but for someone else as a treat for a special occasion I think it's a great gift.

When you physically get to HIGH END SPA everyone has been trained to say that they're ""understaffed"" or ""at capacity."" I can tell you that neither of those things are true and that the employees really don't care and aren't being managed correctly.

I don't know when the landscapers work because I never saw any of them but it must be super early in the morning. They do a great job and I didn't see any plants or other landscape areas or beds that needed attention. That all looked pristine.

I feel like the hot tub pools that you sit in -especially in the mineral baths - needed some resurfacing. I could feel them scraping my bathing suit up but they would have to close them to do this which they will never do. That would be way too much revenue lost.

There was construction as half the locker room sinks and lockers were taken down to rubble. They didn't have this section blocked off in anyway or cover it up. It's just what you got to look at while you were in the locker room. There was also no signage directing you away from it as it in the middle of everything. It was in line with the rest of the experience.

I've been a customer for over 15 years and NEVER have I've had a bad experience from scheduling to today's experience and I am extremely disappointed.

I am currently 32 weeks pregnant and wanted to go in for  a facial & new mum massage along with admission for today. I scheduled a facial days ago and massage wasn't available (called daily in case there was a cancellation). During one of my calls I was advised I wouldn't receive the mask for my facial (it was the one recommended for pregnancy) because I'm pregnant, but I had to pay full price therefore I opted out. Then was advised I could only use 2 of their 19 pools and woman was ify about pregnant women going into Club Mudd. At this point I canceled my admission as well because if I couldn't get a service (at least a massage) I didn't care to just hang out at the pool all day (I have a pool at home) with no services.

Today, my friends showed up and were able to add services and there were plenty of massage appointments available. They booked me a new mum massage at 1:30 PM however I missed out on the day experience with them because I was under the impression they were fully booked (called again yesterday at 3:50 PM to see if they had cancelations).

Decided not to book any treatments, but needless to say it was still great overall. Highlight was the mud bath. PLEASE bring a dark bathing suit, the mud does stain. The drinks and food are good, nothing extraordinary. Overall time spent was about 4-5 hours, couldn't think spending too much time in the spas.","mostRecentVisit_rating",4,"no",NA,"10/29/2019

Although it is a little pricey , it is definitely worth visiting for a spa day! They also offer packages that help you save if your coming with a friend or partner. I also love how they give back by offering free  admission on your birthday.
On both my visits I had a massages booked which left me very relaxed. I also enjoyed the breakfast and lunch at the cafe  definitely worth eating there. Also make sure when visiting the bar you try to the special drink they are making because they are very tasty.
I would also advise in making a reservation prior to arrival to insure you are able to enter in case they are at capacity when you arrive , which is something I really enjoy  since it's not over crowded. Also make sure you relax in the Roman Bath at the end of your day before leaving !

Anyways, the problem that I had here is that one server came off very rude when I asked for an update on one of the items we ordered. My breakfast burrito came out within 10 minutes so we were only missing one omelette. After 20 minutes I finally walked over to a server at the window to ask for an update. I mention that we've been waiting a long time and other patrons who ordered long after we did had already received their food.

She didn't bother to ask what I ordered or what table I was at. She dismissively waved me off saying that they're working on it and it'll be done soon. 10 minutes later I saw one of the kitchen staff point out to that same server that I still had a number on my table, indicating that my order wasn't completed. That's when she finally decided to stop being lazy and check, only to realize that my food was brought to the wrong table.

The Food  feels kind of like a Cafeteria trying to do Upscale food it just falls short for the prices charged. Now with out reentry abilities and no outside food you are kind of held stuck with what you get.  I'll let any of you be the judge but if you read the reviews there are many who feel the same way just putting it in a different way.

The landscape is truly beautiful and feels like you are in an oasis.
My friend and I decided to do the Grotto. We called a day in advanced to reserve this. The staff was very friendly and helpful over the phone. She recommended doing our treatment towards the end of the day.
The locker room: there are a lot of lockers. I suggest bringing nothing bigger than a duffel bag since they are not very big. You do not need a lock; the provide locks. They provide lotion, q tips, & disposable combs as well as towel service. The showers have shampoo, conditioner, & body wash.

The Food: if you are lucky to catch the attention of a staff member around the resort, you can order food & drinks from them. The prices are what you would expect. The small nachos are big enough to feed The Drinks: They have a good selection of drinks that are decently priced. The mixed drinks are made with wine based liquor so they are not very strong. I recommend the lava flow. They also have beer and wine available.

The Atmosphere: It is no doubt that HIGH END SPA is beautiful. The pools are lovely and the foliage makes you feel like you are in an oasis. The guests outside were quiet and everyone keeps to themselves. The only loud guests I encountered were in the grotto and in the Roman baths inside the locker rooms. I understand if you come in a large party it can get loud but some people were just obnoxiously loud. I tried not to let it ruin my experience. The towel service at each ""attraction"" is a very nice touch. The mineral pool was always full so unfortunately I did not get to try that. In the secret garden, I would like to see more hammocks. There were only two.

The Grotto: Try to schedule this at the end of your day! It is a moisturizing treatment and it would be a shame to ruin it by visiting club mud after. This was my favorite part of the day as the mixture they brush on your body smelled heavenly. Towards the end, they offer you tea and fresh fruit. Stay in the sauna room for as long as you can to ensure that your body absorbs in all that heavenly concoction!

TL;DR: Try the Grotto, Club Mud, the Lava Flow drink.

This was my second visit to HIGH END SPA. I brought two of my girlfriends here on a much needed vacation. The spa services were booked a week out but there must have been some cancellations since we were able to squeeze in the grotto experience, massages for two and a facial for me day-of. The staff was especially accommodating and friendly all across the grounds. We enjoyed the convenience of putting a card on file and associating it with your phone number to use throughout the day. We ordered cocktails to sip by the lounge pool which was so relaxing. There were also ample towel and water stations so you could always dry off and stay hydrated.

For me, this is a splurge kind of day that I would only go for a special occasion since it is so pricy. I would definitely recommend to other visitors looking to celebrate or just getaway with good friends.","High","high end massage retreat","Goleta, CA",370,104,220,"Elite '2020","Francesca P.","2019-03-30",3,2,"Mon",7,5,4,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,2,0.042,0.03,0.024,0.006,0.006,0,0.006,0.006,0,0.006,0.006,0.012,11,5,"5","5",1,"rating 5"

Beautiful scenery as you walk up into the area. Friendly staff and great drinks!!

The grotto experience was well worth it. We went into the mud first then the grotto. Great way to relax during the week.

They've improved since the last time I was there with cocktails and a nicer restaurant/cafe atmosphere. The locker rooms are spacious with a steam room and Roman bath as well. Zero amenities, however. Being a past Burke Williams member I can't imagine, with an entry fee AND treatment fees, HIGH END SPA wouldn't be able to match what they offer (robes, sandals, hair/skin product, mouthwash, q-tips, fruit, cucumber water, etc.). Love all the pools and the mud bath (would be great to dip into mud rather than spread it on). Security at the gate is ridiculous since it can create a line up to get in with only one or two people checking bags. Peak days are packed. A daily limit on people in/out would be fantastic for those days, otherwise it's less of a spa and more of a backyard party with people you'd rather not hang with...and their kids.

I say hurry up and fix the damn system and website and put those receptionists to good use at door check. Nothing like driving in traffic to be in more traffic.

On to the main reason. A friend and I ordered 2 discount gift cards for a $200 value and booked treatments. The website would not allow the GC's to be applied to the massage so it was paid for along with the two cards. Once reserved there was no confirmation emailed that the treatment was booked. I had to call the number to confirm and discuss the gift cards. They said they would apply them and to talk to reception when at HIGH END SPA. At the spa, after 30 min of explaining the gift cards were to go to treatment and entry fee with a remainder of $42, and a complete and total lack of listening skills the lady behind the counter, and possibly a manager...not sure, they never introduced themselves, finally made it all work by refunding $58, not applying the $42 (leaving a $100 amount for the GC in my bank account) then doing another refund of $100 to show up in my account a week later...Whaaat? Confusing as hell, really.

Check in at the Grotto was quick. We were taken downstairs and painted this special paint (forgot what it was) that helps your skin then you go down into a rock sauna before you wash off in the most relaxing shower ever.

The Bad:
- SO SO SO CROWDED... The pics do no justice to how incredibly wall-to-wall crowded this place is
- Pretty gross. Clumps of hair in the pools, dead wasps everywhere, can wear shoes in the locker room... Just all around nasty.
- Some staff is cool (especially in the grotto) but otherwise rude, beaten down by life, and slow as molasses in winter.
- food was bland and drowning in sauce or salad dressing, etc
- drinks were processed (not like a fresh, craft cocktail). Hangover city.
- Who the f*@k came up with the layout of this place? I'm not kidding, it's this weird, convoluted maze trying to hide the fact that it's actually a lot smaller than you think
- Hot springs..? More like lukewarm to cold springs with an overcrowded hot tub

The Good:
- the people I was with! Love you girls! xoxo
- The grotto was nice
- Well maintained grounds (trees, rock garden, etc)... More so than the pools it seemed

Good and Bad:
- The mud! Makes your skin glow for the rest of the day, but it REALLY dries you out afterwards! Not good for dry skinned folks like myself. Also the pool is warmish, but also filled with people, dead bugs and probably dead skin... (shudder) If you're renting a robe and get mud on it, they charge to clean.

My advice: SKIP THIS PLACE and find a good Korean Spa! It'll be cheaper and more bang for your buck. Seriously, this place is YIKES!

The Bad:
- SO SO SO CROWDED... The pics do no justice to how incredibly wall-to-wall crowded this place is
- Pretty gross. Clumps of hair in the pools, dead wasps everywhere, can wear shoes in the locker room... Just all around nasty.
- Some staff is cool (especially in the grotto) but otherwise rude, beaten down by life, and slow as molasses in winter.
- food was bland and drowning in sauce or salad dressing, etc
- drinks were processed (not like a fresh, craft cocktail). Hangover city.
- Who the f*@k came up with the layout of this place? I'm not kidding, it's this weird, convoluted maze trying to hide the fact that it's actually a lot smaller than you think
- Hot springs..? More like lukewarm to cold springs with an overcrowded hot tub

The Good:
- the people I was with! Love you girls! xoxo
- The grotto was nice
- Well maintained grounds (trees, rock garden, etc)... More so than the pools it seemed

Good and Bad:
- The mud! Makes your skin glow for the rest of the day, but it REALLY dries you out afterwards! Not good for dry skinned folks like myself. Also the pool is warmish, but also filled with people, dead bugs and probably dead skin... (shudder) If you're renting a robe and get mud on it, they charge to clean.

My advice: SKIP THIS PLACE and find a good Korean Spa! It'll be cheaper and more bang for your buck. Seriously, this place is YIKES!

Our visit was part of my daughters 16th bday present. It was a nice & relaxing stay for the most part. It wasn't very crowded when we were there, so that was a plus. For a short part of our visit, there were women who were being super loud & obnoxious near our cabana. The Grotto was probably the best part of our stay & no one was at the Roman bath when we first arrived there.

HIGH END SPA itself is nice. It attracts a pretty diverse crowd and has a fun but relaxing atmosphere. The mineral pools and salt pools tend to get/stay crowded and it can be uncomfortable standing there waiting for space to get in. The mud area is nice and leaves your skin feeling super soft. One of my favorite spots is the float pool. It's shallow enough to sit and chill without getting your hair wet or you can use the rafts.

The services are ok. I've gotten a couple of massages, a facial, and a pedicure there. The massages have been alright. Nothing to rave about but relaxing. The facial I got hurt my face and the lady was super pushy about product. I had to tell her ""look lady, I didn't come here to spent $$ on products."" The pedicure was decent, but I'd rather pay my regular lady a fraction of the cost for similar service. The services are pricey and only moderately worth it.

If you don't want to rent loungers, I recommend you get there early.  The early bird gets the good seating area.

Shout out to Xema (I think that's her name) for helping us out with our drinks and food and a suprise cupcake with candle.  She was so sweet and after several fail attempts to get waiters/waitress she kept coming back to see if we were good.

She kept stating ""per our policy"" blah blah, ""we can't refund you because we were extremely busy on Sunday"". MIND BLOWN.

365,"mostRecentVisit_review"," My mother and I went to HIGH END SPA for our annual mother daughter trip. With all of the stressors of life it was very appealing to have a little calmness and stress relief. This place was not the place to do it. It felt like a Las Vegas Pool party that I wanted no part with. Mind you there was some relaxing moments like the message and message area, the spa for facials and the grotto experience. Thankfully my mother and I got the Date Palm Cabana which I felt was the only reason we lasted the day because it was our peaceful spot amongst the chaos.

The Bad
- I felt the place was below my standards of cleanliness
For them to close at 9pm and open up the next day at 9-' it was quite apparent that they don't thoroughly clean the area.
- We arrived at 9:30 and the bathrooms were dirty, the elevator to the cabana was dirty, and the first pool we went into which was in the bathhouse had brown dirty bubbles forming with a light brown film.
- The cabana seating and chairs were dirty as well so we draped towels over everything before we sat down.
- Waaaay over crowded, the pools are not that big to begin with and each pool was packed to where all you could do is stand in one spot.
- everyone walked around barefoot and then go directly into pools and mud and what not without showering before hand thus bringing all that dirt from their feet into the pools. After my first pool in the bathhouse I couldn't bring myself to get in anymore water.
- the bathhouse was a madhouse and the bathrooms were really dirty. In the showers I saw mold on shower curtains and on the walls and borders. Everything just felt really dirty.

Th good

- I had an amazing Massage from Brad...I wish he worked at other locations besides just there because he's worth revisiting!!! And he was so kind and really good at what he does

- the Cabana is the way to go if you do come here!!! We had preferred parking right in the front, got to skip the line to enter the building and was taken right to the cabana hostess area that had some tea. After checking you in they escort you to your cabana as well as give you a lay of the land. We had a nice semi private cabana away from the crazy, a private jacuzzi just for cabana users, fresh fruit bowl, and the convenience of ordering crops and having it brought to you (which was great because the restaurant got absolutely crazy busy) This cabana made our trip and I'm so happy we opted in for this.

- the grotto was very cool and relaxing and I felt like I was at a spa there. I loved that green stuff they lathered on us and kept wanting to rub it all over...the cave itself is pretty cool too.

- The Nachos and Cupcakes,.....heard a lot about the nachos so I had high expectations which they lived up to but no one talks about the cupcakes which were amazing and soooo moist!!!

- the sax player that came for the twilight portion. He was EXCELLENT!!! We actually stayed longer to listen to him (in our private cabana deck)

Overall we had a decent time...I am most thankful for the time spent with my mom but I wouldn't come back unless just for a massage which the entrance fee to get in for a massage isn't worth it.","mostRecentVisit_rating",3,"no",NA,"10/13/2019

The alcohol is rampantly flowing. The loud ratchetness is above and beyond. All so they can make a buck. I get it yo, times is tough, you gotta make that paper.. but really though?

The sheer number of people at the spa must make it difficult to maintain the facility in a timely and cleanly manner. Detritus floating around in and on the bottom of all the pools. People just leaving their crap around anywhere and everywhere. Guests being loud, disgusting, and overall unaware of anything outside of themselves is not something the spa can control, I get it, but maybe don't let THAT many people in all at once so you can make that paper? All these social media obsessed individuals with their phones out constantly. Drunk people being loud and obnoxious. This does not make for a relaxing spa experience, that I dropped a huge chunk of change for.

Also, seems pretty unprofessional for your staff to be hovering in a group in the locker room, airing out their grievances with each other, when there are clearly quite a number of guest around everywhere. I get it boo, I get stressed with work too, but do that on your break time, away from guests. That's just unprofessional; entertaining for me, but really unprofessional.

The staff, by and large, were friendly enough when approached. But no one really went out of their way to provide that bit of extra customer service. Like, Boo, I can tell you hate your job right now.

The food at the on-site cafeteria style... ""restaurant""... umm... it was just whatever. Very lackluster. Just expensive for what you get, for truck stop/gas station-esque quality.

Am I being too self-entitled, snobby, first world problems, complaining? Perhaps just a smidge. Long story short. The staff is friendly enough. The facilities are pretty on the surface, at first glance. Was not a relaxing time or vibe due to the sheer number of people jam packed into the place.

We started the day by getting to the hot springs right when they opened which was perfect! We were able to get first picks and enjoy the pools for a few hours before bigger crowds came. There are 19 pools here and each one is different! Hot tubs, epsom salt pools, hot and cold plunge pools, heated pools, lounging pools and more! All of these pools plus Club Mud (red clay treatment) is included in the price of admission!

The day moves by so quickly as you are just lost in relaxation land! Before I knew it the day was over and I was so sad to leave. Honestly, though the place is pricey, its worth every penny as this is the best experience I have ever had.

We rented a cabana, had massages, and experienced the grotto.   We had such a wonderful time, that we decided to make it an annual event.   Well this year when we visited HIGH END SPA, our experience made us rethink our decision.   The customer service was absolutely horrific.   We made our reservation in July, to ensure we would have the same experience we had last year.   Well upon our arrive at 8:45, our initial experience was a precursor to the remainder of our day.   There was a long line to check in, once we made it to the front of the line, to our amazement there was one security person, checking each person purses and bags with a fine-tooth comb.  She put her hands on everything in my spa bag, even though when I opened it, you could clearly see there was nothing but a bathing suit and some water shoes.  I felt actually invaded.

Service has diminished within the past year.  Last year, a group of my friends and I (total of 5) visited HIGH END SPA for a day of relaxation.   We rented a cabana, had massages, and experienced the grotto.   We had such a wonderful time, that we decided to make it an annual event.   Well this year when we visited HIGH END SPA, our experience made us rethink our decision.   The customer service was absolutely horrific.   We made our reservation in July, to ensure we would have the same experience we had last year.   Well upon our arrive at 8:45, our initial experience was a precursor to the remainder of our day.   There was a long line to check in, once we made it to the front of the line, to our amazement there was one security person, checking each person purses and bags with a fine-tooth comb.  She put her hands on everything in my spa bag, even though when I opened it, you could clearly see there was nothing but a bathing suit and some water shoes.  I felt actually invaded.  But I thought to myself, ""the day will get better, move on and enjoy the wonderful relaxing day"".   Well when we went to check in to get our cabana, we were told there was an additional charge of $50 for the fifth person in our party.

It was I'm guessing less crowded than it normally was. The only thing is maybe it was a little cold when you got out of the pool onto something else.
We got there around 9.45 am. Short line- it went very quickly. Check in was a breeze. Got the total wellness package.
We went to the wine bar and got our wrist bracelets first. Once you get that there's no need for them to check ID every time you order a drink. Got a mimosa and then went to put our stuff away in the lockers which was right next door.
Next stop mineral pools. We managed to snag an individual one that just fits two but why so few? It must be an awful wait for it during the weekends. The mineral water was lovely.
I then had a nourishing facial at the salon. Hailey was wonderful!! My face felt amazing after we were done.  my boyfriend lounged in the bean bag type floats at the lounge pool. Next up was his massage. He got the aroma soul and really loved it too. I waited in the saline pool while he was done.
We then had lunch. While a little pricy, the food was good. Had a chopped salad with some tortilla soup and a glass of Chardonnay from the wiens winery. The line took forever initially because there was only one cashier. They really shouldn't do that during the lunch hour. We sat inside because it was cold. We then went to the hot and cold pools and the vista pool. We made our way to the lap pool for the aqua tone class. Never done a class with weights under water. What fun!! it's just half hour.
We then made it to club mud. There's 4 steps to it.  it!! We went straight into the pool - Not what we were supposed to do. Supposed to go towards the right. Slather yourself with mud and dry yourself in the sauna and then pool and then shower. Oh well.
It would have been nice if the guy in the front had told us that when we came in.
Finally, we went to the grotto. Just loved the grotto!! What a wonderful experience. My skin felt so smooth after all the slathering of lotion.

The reason I gave 3 instead of 5 stars, was because the locker rooms and bathrooms weren't as clean and they probably could have been.

I'm not sure if they've changed management or if they have less staffing in January because it's not peak season but today was a pretty nasty experience. For starters when I got into the Jacuzzi this morning there was nasty white scum clods and rings of hair around the bars/rails. It was like 10am lol. I remember in past visits that they would shut down the Jacuzzis and pools every couple hours to clean them so I thought maybe that it was getting close to the cleaning time so I left and came back later in the afternoon around 4 PM and there was even more scum them before and the same hearing was there. Guess they don't clean the pools/jacuzzis anymore and it shows and is disgusting. Next, my husband and I LOVEEEEE The chicken nachos, we get excited to eat them every time we come. Today they were total letdown. Not only are they in a smaller dish now (but same $18 price!) but it was a soggy soup. I couldn't even eat them like nachos because my chips were soggy by the time I got to my table, I didn't even eat half of them. I decided to let it go because I was here to relax and not worry about drama. At the end of the day when I went inside to take a shower the shower nozzle was loose and wouldn't stay in place so if I didn't hold it the entire shower it would scold me with hot water. That was pretty annoying because I enjoy the shower at the end of the day because of the wonderful rain showerheads but it was kind of lame since I had to hold the handle the entire time. Earlier in the day when I was in the caf I asked if I could get a copy of all of today's transactions somewhere at HIGH END SPA and they told me that I could go to the front counter and get a copy of everything that I paid for today (you can put your card on tab and charge all your purchases which is nice so you don't have to carry your wallet around. After showering and getting ready to leave I walk to the front counter to get my print out and she told me that they couldn't do a print out of the food and then I would need to go back to the caf to get a receipt. I want to back to the caf and it was closed. When I told her this she said that she could do a print out but it would take 45 minutes. Ummm what?! What kind of ancient computer system do you have that it takes 45mins to print a copy of my transactions for the day. All of these were little things but then I realized at the end of the day there were about 5 really annoying things that added up to me not having a great experience. Enough to make me wonder if the hour drive and high prices are really worth it anymore. Best part of the day by far was the staff, everyone was super nice and amazing. Even the lady who told me it would take her 45mins to print my receipt was nice lol. Hoping it was just a perfect storm that added up to a lame day for me and that this isn't the norm anymore. Anyways, I WANT THE OLD HIGH END SPA BACK!! I was texting my husband when I first got here that I would prob come here every few months to detox and chill but prob not anymore. If you come to get a massage ask for Alexandra!!!! She was amazing!!

380,"mostRecentVisit_review","I went to HIGH END SPA maybe 12 or 15 years ago and loved it.  So when it was suggested to me as a little respite from the craziness of the world for a day, I was all in.  While we did have a good time, it was pretty much as many of these other reviews talk about:
***Incredibly expensive: From the entrance fee of $75 to the high cost food/drinks and then services on top of it...ugh I just felt like I was getting ripped off all day
***Incredibly crowded: Like so crowded we had trouble finding 2 chairs together at 10 in the morning.  
***Hard to enjoy the cool amenities with max capacity being met: I know I just said it's incredibly crowded but I feel like I should make a special note that during the summer they are often hitting max occupancy.  That means people are getting turned away at the door and that everything the facilities have to offer, is being used to the max.  It's just not relaxing...it's Disneyland.

So there are still bright spots of course:
***The wellness areas are cool: I like the mud area and the hot springs and the hot/cool plunges.  They are included in the entrance fee and without them there would be no point in coming here as opposed to another day spa.
***The Grotto: I loved the Grotto treatment where they paint you with this moisturizing goodness and then you sit on these damp rocks for as long as you want until you have a fantastic shower and tea/apples.  It's all underground and gorgeous and novel.  Not sure it's worth the price but it is certainly a one-time must-do.

So I am not sure when we will come back.  I had a group of girlfriends that wanted to do a spa day and we coordinated with HIGH END SPA to secure cabanas here....but as we were adding up the cost of paying for the cabana PLUS entrance fee PLUS services PLUS food/drinks we quickly discovered that we could go somewhere else for half the price and much nicer, less crowded facilities.","mostRecentVisit_rating",3,"no",NA,"8/26/2019
I went to HIGH END SPA maybe 12 or 15 years ago and loved it.  So when it was suggested to me as a little respite from the craziness of the world for a day, I was all in.  While we did have a good time, it was pretty much as many of these other reviews talk about:
***Incredibly expensive: From the entrance fee of $75 to the high cost food/drinks and then services on top of it...ugh I just felt like I was getting ripped off all day
***Incredibly crowded: Like so crowded we had trouble finding 2 chairs together at 10 in the morning.  
***Hard to enjoy the cool amenities with max capacity being met: I know I just said it's incredibly crowded but I feel like I should make a special note that during the summer they are often hitting max occupancy.  That means people are getting turned away at the door and that everything the facilities have to offer, is being used to the max.  It's just not relaxing...it's Disneyland.

So there are still bright spots of course:
***The wellness areas are cool: I like the mud area and the hot springs and the hot/cool plunges.  They are included in the entrance fee and without them there would be no point in coming here as opposed to another day spa.
***The Grotto: I loved the Grotto treatment where they paint you with this moisturizing goodness and then you sit on these damp rocks for as long as you want until you have a fantastic shower and tea/apples.  It's all underground and gorgeous and novel.  Not sure it's worth the price but it is certainly a one-time must-do.
***Free Parking: For as much as they rake you over the coals on everything else, I appreciate that the parking is free if you self-park.

After exploring the entire spa, we noticed that it wasn't as big as the map suggested, which was actually a good thing because all of the pools were within a 30 second walk from each other. It was great that there were so many pools and all for different functions. The mud bath was pretty fun since it was socially acceptable to be dirty and roll around in mud. The hot and cold pools were awesome too because your body goes in shock from the temperature change. I also received a massage at HIGH END SPA and it was pretty relaxing!

We started by grabbing drinks at the bar- all cocktails are wine based and $10.50. You can put a card on file and just use your phone number which is much easier than paying with a card! A few of the pools we hit were the mineral, sulfur (remember to remove all jewelry), hot/cold baths (my husband did those and loved it) and of course club mud! The mud was surprisingly relaxing and fun. Definitely wear a suit you don't mind getting dirty!
The Grotto was a fun experience as well! No drinks are allowed past the entry to reach the elevators. Basically you stand in a stall and an attendant paints you with hot green oils/lotion! After that you go into a room that is similar to a sauna and hang out to let the moisturizer soak in (you put it all over your hair and face as well for the full benefits). They didn't tell us, but they recommend staying in that room for 15 mins (we had to go ask). Unfortunately there were other people who were being loud, even though there were many signs, which made it hard to totally zen out. Once everything is washed off, you go into the cold room where they have tea options and yummy green apples!
Lunch was also fabulous! I had a chopped salad and carrot cake. So good! They offer many options, such as wraps, flatbreads and sandwiches.
An added bonus is the Starbucks they have right near the entrance! Perfect when you're on the way out!
I can't wait to return to HIGH END SPA in the near future and hopefully book a massage or another added experience to our day!!!

They also provide free lockers which was helpful since I was in and out of mine all day.

In the locker room, they obviously have a lockers and showers but also a wet sauna and a huge indoor jaccuzi tub. I found the jaccuzi temp to be comparable to some of the ones outside. I hung out in the lounge pool where they had mats and beanbags for you to lay in the water which is where I read a lot of my book.

They also had:
*A hot tub and cold plunge pool next to it which I was too chicken to go into since it wasn't the warmest day
*2 more Jacuzzi which I felt were pretty much the same temperature so I alternated between those just to get a change of scenery
*A couple dry saunas that can fit about 6 people each
*An area with some mats and a couple of hammocks
*Some couple sized sulfer baths
*A massage area which I didn't use/can't afford

My favorite was Club Mud. You put mud on yourself, go into a slightly heated room to let it dry and then wash it off. My skin felt sooo smooth after and I couldn't stop touching it!

I came in early Jan on a Fri and luckily the weather was not too cold to sit out. It also didn't have as many people as I know it could. It was mostly couples and bachelorette parties.

My check in experience was seamless, but it started to go down hill almost immediately. My friend and I got croissant sandwiches from Starbucks which was not good at all. There were more grapes and cucumbers on the sandwich than chicken. In addition, the chicken was poor quality. It was definitely not organic and was fatty, fat should not be in chicken salad.

I then had a pedicure, which was great. She was very nice and professional. She did an amazing job and was very thorough.

I later went to the north pool and ordered a drink. I saw the charge for the Over the course of the next couple of hours, I saw multiple charges hit my credit card. I hadn't purchased anything else after two failed attempts at food and drinks. So I was very baffled as to why I had additional charges to my credit card. I later went to the front check in desk and requested to speak to a manager to understand why my card was charged so many times.

I had a very lackluster experience. I was under the impression that HIGH END SPA was a supposed to be a luxury experience, but I have have a better experience at Chic fil a....... which says a lot. I was very underwhelmed.

My check in experience was seamless, but it started to go down hill almost immediately. My friend and I got croissant sandwiches from Starbucks which was not good at all. There were more grapes and cucumbers on the sandwich than chicken. In addition, the chicken was poor quality. It was definitely not organic and was fatty, fat should not be in chicken salad.

I then had a pedicure, which was great. She was very nice and professional. She did an amazing job and was very thorough.

I later went to the north pool and ordered a drink. I saw the charge for the 1 drink get posted to my credit card but didn't receive my drink  for another 10 to 15 minutes.  Once it came out she said an additional drink was accidently made and asked if I wanted it. I said sure and signed my receipt for 1 drink and I added a tip.  I then got another notification for the charge of the 2nd drink. Not only did the server not mention that she would be charging me for the 2nd drink that I didn't order, but she didn't even bring me a new slip so sign with the new amount. Charging someone's card for an amount that they did not agree to is very unethical.  I have worked as a server and bartender and I have never charged someone for something they didn't explicitly agree to pay for. In addition, she sold it to me as a mango margarita, the drink came out spicy which was not something I would ever order. But I didn't make a big deal about it because I knew she was busy. But when the server came back out and wasn't busy, I asked her if she had in fact charged me for the  2nd drink and she stated that she did.

Over the course of the next couple of hours, I saw multiple charges hit my credit card. I hadn't purchased anything else after two failed attempts at food and drinks. So I was very baffled as to why I had additional charges to my credit card. I later went to the front check in desk and requested to speak to a manager to understand why my card was charged so many times.  The manager looked over my charges and I spoke to her about my experience with the drink. I didn't bring up the sandwich because they look like they weren't made in house, so that is just probably just poor purchasing from from a corporate level. She took off the tip I gave for my drink since there was an issue with the 2nd drink and assured me that there were no additional charges to the 3 mentioned below. She said the additional charges on there would fall off.

So there should be a charge for my pedicure, the starbucks croissant sandwich, and the 1 drink. That plus the pending charges that she stated were going to fall off. Upon leaving the resort, after what was supposed to be an relaxing and enjoyable end to my birthday celebration, I received another charge to my credit card. At this point I am in my car and still have not made any purchases since the last drink which was hours before I last spoke to a manager. I don't know what that charge is for and why there were additional charges after I went over everything with the manager?

The whole experience is not seamless at all. I definitely feel that carrying my card around all day and just swiping it each time would have been way easier. It is extremely apparent that you guys don't have this process down packed. There is only 3 receipts that you guys should have with my signature on it, so what are the other charges for? Disappointed is an understatement to say the least.  

Overall the views and property are gorg, the representatives at the front desk are great and the woman who did my pedicure was bomb.

3. Price- it's way overpriced for what you get. Drinks were expensive and barely tasted like alcohol. I sat there and watched them make my Bloody Mary and grab a piece of bacon that had bees in the container. The bartender even joked ""want your drink with bee or no bee?"" It was just gross.

Went here for the first time and was seriously impressed all around! I knew this place books up fast so I called a few weeks early to schedule a massage and admission on a summer weekday. The checkin process at 9:30 AM was less busy than anticipated which was nice! Make sure you read your email on ""what to know"" because the front desk doesn't give you info on lockers, alcohol wristband etc. The facilities are overall maintained incredibly well considering how many people are there! It could get gross really fast but every area was clean, including the bathrooms.

One drawback was the lounge chair situation, there are not enough for how many people are there. I didn't take off a star though, because you honestly don't need a lounge chair, there are so many pools to go into and relax. My massage was great and our experience with the kitchen was awesome and quick on the day we went. Make sure you have them add a card on file so you don't have to lug one around :)

I was mostly impressed with the value to the dollar. I know some reviews are contrary to that, but for about $50 admission you get consistent towels available, water stations and shower stations at club mud along with nice toiletries, qtips, blowdriers etc in the bathrooms. They could easily nickel and dime for all of those but I felt truly pampered and VIP with just general admission.

We did the grotto service it was okay the skin does feel super smooth but I didn't get that ""undercave"" feeling. Really pretty places and spots to take selfies and all.

I was extremely excited for a day of relaxation but was disappointed in the service I receive at the South Spa. My appointment was at 5:00 pm so I arrived 15 minutes early as recommended by the front counter staff, but therapist did not bring me back in the room until after 5:00. During the massage I asked if it was possible to adjust the temperature on the bed because it was extremely cold. She informed me that it was on the highest level. I explained to her that I was extremely cold but she continued with the massage. The lotion and oils were cold as well. When she was finished I looked at the time and it was 5:50 which means I did not get my full 50 minutes of therapy.

The services are amazing as well but you can easily enjoy the facility without doing anything extra. I highly recommend the Grotto, it's pretty inexpensive and it's a truly enjoyable experience. They start you off by taking you down an elevator into what feels like a real cave. After they lather you down with a warm combination of creams and oils with a giant paintbrush (feels amazing) you head over to a heated part of the grotto and relax and let all the oils soak into your skin. You can let it soak for is long as you want and after you're done there are showers you can shower off with and they send you to the next part of the grotto where they provide apples, hot tea and water.

It's pretty fun to hop into the mud bath and coat yourself with a nice, thick layer of therapeutic mud.

I've heard of HIGH END SPA before but just thought it was only pools. I got to go with two coworkers who are amazing ladies. We all met up at our office at 9am and fasttraked it to corona which definitely saved time. Upon arrival we checked in and changed into our swimsuits. It was a great weather day not too hot or too cold. The first one we tried was the ice plunge. Which is 5minutes in a hot spring jazzuci and then 60seconds in a cold pool. It was intense. But I did it five times and after that my back pain and muscles were non-existent. Next we made it over to the lounge pool and grabbed some floaties and I fell asleep. Then off to lunch to nibble a bit. We all shared nachos, pizza and sandwiches. Nachos were to die for. After our tummies were satisified we played in mud and helped cover each other head to toe when then left to the sulfur baths (my coworker called them fart tubs) and let it take out those yucky toxins and open up pores. We had a standing 2pm appointment with the grotto. Signed some waivers and were led underground by a sweet guy named bryan. I think we made his day he was laughing with us when my coworker asked him to paint her like one of his french girls (like jack in titanic) he just laughed with us and kept going. After we were painted we did a hotttttt sauna for 15minutes then showered off and relaxed in the cold room with barrels of apples, teas and waters. Overall a great day I feel like im a lot closer now with these two coworkers and its a fun place to go with a group or as a couple. Ill go back when I really need that ice plunge bath again and the grotto.","mostRecentVisit_rating",5,"no",NA,"12/14/2019

Tucked away in the hills of Corona, this spot is unlike any other. From it's beautiful landscaping to its many pools, there is something here for everyone. Free parking is provided. Little ponds throughout the ground even
provide a home for some tiny friends, turtles.
Entry fees are higher on the weekends and have a birthday special with free admission with certain terms and conditions. With your entry fee you receive use of the locker room, access to HIGH END SPA's many pools, the mud bath, water aerobics, and much more. Upon entering your bags are checked by an employee before you step into the lobby to pay. From there you can browse the gift shop or head to the locker rooms.
 Inside the locker rooms it's HUGE! A changing area, bathrooms, lockers, a Roman bath, showers, and a sauna. This place is epic! So once you change to your swimwear it's time to check everything out! You can book massages, facials, or grotto services with the attendants outside the locker room. I HIGHLY recommend booking your services in advance since they tend to book up fast. The grotto is an underground cave where you receive a body treatment applied to your skin by an attendant, painted on like a body mask. Then you hangout in an underground rock cave for 20 minutes or so while it dries before finding off in one of the beautiful rock showers. While you wait to dry they serve ice water, hot tea, and apples.
One of the best things about HIGH END SPA is the food. From the amazing sangria to the chicken nachos, you can't go wrong. The nachos are huge!!!! Two people could easily share a full order and still get full. The food is a little pricy but well worth it with freshness and portions.
My favorite part of HIGH END SPA I'd say is the mud bath. You dip into a giant pool full of muddy water where you cover yourself in the red clay mud and laugh as you look at one another like a swamp monster. If you'd rather not go into the mud pool they have a separate clay station for our more skeptical friends.
So if you're looking for a fun bachelorette activity, a pre baby day with your friends, or just a romantic day with your honey this is the place.","mostRecentVisit_rating",5,"no",NA,"12/14/2018

420,"mostRecentVisit_review","  I've been to HIGH END SPA three times. My review is for my most recent experience. I will say that the first couple times I have gone I'll admit it gets sooooo packed, and it's kind of gross, you literally can't see the bottom of the pool bc there are bodies everywhere cramping in every possible little corner. You can't put your towel on a chair... actually good luck in finding a chair, the lines for the food and drinks are ridiculous and of course overpriced. It ruins the experience bc you are seriously just waiting for space in any pool. BUT....

Today I don't know if it's because it's December and people think it is cold, but it was not packed at all. My experience when it wasn't like sardine packed was amazing. My husband and I got to go to every pool more than once and got to fully experience the whole area with as much time as we wanted. I even discovered there was something called a secret garden, which I didn't even know existed the last couple times I went. It's a cute little area in like a grass section with two huge hammocks, which yes bc it wasn't so crowded me and my husband both got to chill on a hammock as long as we wanted, I fell asleep actually ahhaha. I was so relaxed.

The experience this time gets four stars because I really enjoyed the whole place and got to spend as little or as long of a time I wanted at ALL of the areas. My personal favorite pool is the mineral baths that smells like sulfur and the Epsom salts one. I really felt it cleansed my skin and helped relax my muscles. My husband loved the hot and cold pools, he felt it really helped with his blood circulation and his tense muscles (he plays a lot of basketball). The saunas are actually a cool experience too with different oaks burning, it was different. The mud area is definitely an experience, it really exfoliates your skin and leaves your skin super soft, and it makes for great photos!

The facilities itself is very clean and kept up. I did not meet one staff member who wasn't super friendly and welcoming...good job on the customer service skills!! The  kitchen which is the only area you can buy food, actually serves really good food, but again it costs like an arm and a leg. My favorite item was the ahi burger, a huge slice of seared ahi, and their aoli sauce/slaw was super flavorful on a toasted brioche bun.

Besides the many different pools, the saunas, different areas to relax in and the mud area, HIGH END SPA offers extra services such as personal massages, pedicures or manicures, facials etc. My husband and I did a couples massage and we both wanted to shout out our therapists. Both were super professional, respectful and did a great job on our massages. If you want a good massage at HIGH END SPA I highly recommend Cheri and he recommends Samantha. Thanks girls!

In the end, I love that this is offered in this area. It was an amazing experience.... again when it is not packed. I do think it IS pricey, for the price we pay for all the services I think a ary robe should be included. We rented the robes for $Tip: if you book a massage you get a discount on the admission.

For the luxury price tag on entry and cabana rental in addition to 400$ in services I would at least like to feel valued as a guest. The pillows in our ($200 per day) cabana were stained with fake tan. My mom requested no tomato on her sandwich, it was delivered with tomato (no biggie, it was promptly replaced) Then I discovered that my (albeit, tasty) chicken Cesar salad had no chicken. I politely alerted our concierge who informed me that they just yesterday began charging an extra 5$ for chicken but had *not yet* changed it on the menu. They honored the old menu and brought me some refrigerated deli cubed chicken. Not warm or freshly grilled. 17$ salad. (Sorry I work in a nice restaurant, I notice).

This is not a quiet, serene place to unwind. The vibe was very ""rose all day"". Too many loud party people. Even in the off season. Also, please figure out a better system for re entry. People who smoke cigarettes are still human beings. Paying customers. Treat them as such. We will be spending our future spa days elsewhere.","High","high end massage retreat","Temecula, CA",0,2,NA,NA,"Amy A.","2019-11-22",NA,NA,"Sun",11,3,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,0,0.059,0.016,0.011,0,0,0,0.011,0,0.011,0.005,0,0,7,5,"5","5",0,"rating 2"

I was able to get pool side service (took a long while to get my drinks and finding a staff member was a little painful) but it was still completed without mess ups.

I arrived on a busy Friday mid morning. Very friendly, inviting young lady checked me in. I had not pre paid my spa services, luckily they did have a facial and massage opening.
Pretty packed. Busy day at the spa.
I put my stuff in the ary locks and enjoyed the Roman pool located in the women's locker room. Only 2 occupants. Enjoyed this for 30 minutes then off to my next stop. Dry sauna!! Smelled very refreshing and relaxing. I only lasted 7 minutes!!! Extremely warm inside. But good for you.
Lunch was delicious. I ordered a salad ($18). Scrumptious salad with green goddess dressing. Quite pricey yet nice portion size. Incredibly nice gentlemen customized my salad, thank you.
Facial. Good but not great. The lady was very friendly and knowledgeable. But she was a little rough. Not very tender. I was getting a facial not a Swedish massage. Not as quite relaxing as I desired.
Massage. Was good not great. I get massages on a monthly basis. And this was average. I requested light light pressure, a relaxing massage. This particular massage therapist light pressure was more like medium pressure. Overall good massage.
Overall exceptional experience and will return soon!!!

Treated myself to a birthday spa day!! Well needed. Free birthday admission on your actual birthday ($50 value) with the purchase of a spa service. I bought 2 spa services. An organic facial ($110) and aroma therapy 50 min. Massage ($100).
I arrived on a busy Friday mid morning. Very friendly, inviting young lady checked me in. I had not pre paid my spa services, luckily they did have a facial and massage opening.
Pretty packed. Busy day at the spa.
I put my stuff in the ary locks and enjoyed the Roman pool located in the women's locker room. Only 2 occupants. Enjoyed this for 30 minutes then off to my next stop. Dry sauna!! Smelled very refreshing and relaxing. I only lasted 7 minutes!!! Extremely warm inside. But good for you.
Lunch was delicious. I ordered a salad ($18). Scrumptious salad with green goddess dressing. Quite pricey yet nice portion size. Incredibly nice gentlemen customized my salad, thank you.
Facial. Good but not great. The lady was very friendly and knowledgeable. But she was a little rough. Not very tender. I was getting a facial not a Swedish massage. Not as quite relaxing as I desired.
Massage. Was good not great. I get massages on a monthly basis. And this was average. I requested light light pressure, a relaxing massage. This particular massage therapist light pressure was more like medium pressure. Overall good massage.
Overall exceptional experience and will return soon!!!

My husband and I went here for the first time today and I have to admit, I loved it! I'd love to go there every month if I can.
We got ""winter warmth package"" which comes with Entree fees, robes, 50 min massage, Grotto, hot chocolate, and cookie.

The robe was comfy and thick which kept us warm even it is December! I was worried I might be cold because I get cold very easily but the robe did a really good job. You could also bring your own robe if you don't wanna pay extra $15 for the robes. (Ours was included in the package so it was free)

They also had like warm lounge pool which they had floating bean bag and blue floating boards. I'd suggest to go while it is still warm (Around noon). We tried around 3 and it was too cold for me. The North and South pools are not heated. Also the mud bath was so nice! you can immediately feel your skin smooth after you wash them off. There is warm room where you can dry your mud too if the outside is cold. Vista pool was a bit disappointing because they said they have nice view but you only really can see the parking lot and some mountain...

The massage was also disappointing. They give you a from to ask which part you want to be worked on and not but i don't think my therapist looked at it.

I wish this could have been a better review. BUT due to poor communication between workers its not. We had booked our grotto for 12:30pm . When we arrived they where running 15 mins behind no big deal . It was supposed to be a day of no stress. We where then told to fill out our waivers which we did. I put down that I cannot have Eucalyptus oil. We then get called back . I tell the lady at the door to take us down , hey I am the lady that cant have eucalyptus oil. She goes perfect I will let them know when we get down to use grape sead. Perfect. We go down she makes sure to tell them stall #9 needs grape sead oil and they repeat it back . Stall 1 starts to get her gel painted on and then a gentleman comes out and straight for me . Thinking ok hes got my special stuff. He started to paint it then tells me to hold out my hand and put it on like my face and stuff but not my forehead or bottom of my feet . Perfect ready for this stuff to make my skin feel great. Not 20 seconds after i have now rubbed it all on my face , the girl walks out and says who needs grape seeds oil. Sheer panic. NO wonder i was tingling . The guy looks at me and say OH fuck about the same time I do . Rushes me to the showers and turns on all the heads and tells me to start scrubbing he will be back with soap . Which he never came back . My two friends now have come rushing to help me get this crap off faster. ( NOT relaxing ) . scrub it all off to go back in . Have the right stuff put on . I cant relax cause now im itching. He comes and checks on me and I ask him for special soap cause i never got it. He gives it to me . BUT not one employee comes and sees if I'm ok . Two employees knew that he messed up . I mean THANK god I am not so allergic that I went into shock but let me tell you I now look like a 16 year old in high school with how broken out I am .  So really what is the point of the waviers ? so they can mess it up even more?????

I came here for my bachelorette party and then again the weekend after from Orange County.
First we did the grotto which probably would have been amazing if this big group of girls weren't yelling (there are signs everywhere to whisper). To give the worker credit he did try to ask them to be quite but it failed. I have general anxiety disorder and PTSD so obviously I try to do things in a nice quite environment (they can't control my disorders but just giving you a understanding of how my body was feeling which is completely out of my control). It got even worse.... they can't control the weather BUT when I went to the front to book a massage there was only one available at 5pm. I booked it. Soon after it got really cold and windy. I was in a wind breaker coat and couldn't get warm. I decided that it was so unbearable that I would ask to cancel my message. I went to the front desk and was approached by a manager named David. He was so rude. No smile, no empathy and no kindness. I asked him if I could cancel my message and he said no- it's way to late because there is a policy. I asked why I wasn't informed of that information when ordering the message at the front desk. I also asked why the cancellation policy was not written on the receipt I signed. He rudely said ""most people already know there is a cancelation policy"". Obviously my anxiety started. He made it a argument instead of an understanding. He was awful and I don't understand why he is a manager. Then I talk to another manager who clearly saw I was really upset and I disclosed that at this point I wasn't going to get the massage as I was way to anxious to even enjoy it. If David started out nice- none of this would have even happened. I WILL NEVER GO BACK. I left before my massage and have the receipt. I will be contacting David's boss and reporting this to my bank.

There were also some groups - like bachelorette's, birthday parties - and folks mainly kept to themselves, I didn't feel weird coming solo.

Some of my tips/suggestions:
- Do your facial at the end of your visit (I definitely washed away all of my first professional facial loveliness)
- There are ary lockers, great shampoo/conditioner/body wash, lotion with hair dryers available, towels everywhere
- Check out the daily schedule - when I went they had zumba, qi gong, and yoga
- Definitely use the map to check everything out - hot springs (right behind the main pool that's at the entrance), club mud (there's a hot room on the side, the facial lady recommended not to put the mud on your face), mineral pools, roman bath and steam room, dry heat rooms, hot/cold pools
- I didn't do it since I felt there was more than enough to do but heard good things about the grotto - seems like it'd be especially good if you go in a group since you can stick together

For the classic facial: They recommend arriving 15 minutes prior, offer hot tea just to the right of the front door with private bathroom down the right hall. You remove your top including bra and get cozy underneath the soft blanket. I opted for the classic facial and was recommended to get the organic version for $15 more (felt a little up-sell-y), was relaxing however I'm breaking out a few days out.. not sure if this is typical?

The club mud is really unique from other spa places I have been to. It dries out so fast that you need to either reapply another thin layer on your skin or so rinse it off before it dries your skin.
The Grotto treatment is a whole body mask treatment with additional $25. It adds the perfect ending to our experience.
The staffs by the pool sides are very polite and friendly. I see them constantly folding new towels for customers and taking away used one. I had not encountered any staffs that was rude or impolite. However, the kitchen staff who was tall and works as the one who takes orders that was a bit of inpatient when we requested vegan food. His facial expression was subtle and walked away when we requested changing lettuce wraps to slices of toast.
The food was okay but not so much vegan/allergy friendly. I guess better than nothing to choose from.
They also have juice bar and Starbucks for you to choose from.
There are some classes throughout the day such as Tai-chi, yoga, aqua fitness. These are few of charge. You can definitely make the best out of it.
The only thing I don't really appreciate is people don't respect the rules of being quiet. They talk out loud when there is a sign saying talk in whisper volume. And the staff don't really try to discourage this behavior. If you prefer tranquil experience, the one in NorCal called Refuge has better quiet policy.

The overcrowding and rude staff are unfortunate. I'm involved right now in the spa/hospitality industry as well, and I know that mismanagement has wide-ranging effects on a work environment.

Very mediocre service.  No one is really interested in service with a smile and happy to help.  If someone is paying for a lovely experience, you would hope your staff is there to help with that.  Not here.
It was close to the Twilight menu which starts at 5pm.  We asked one of the cabana attendants if we could place an order and her response was, it's not 5 yet.  It was 4:50.  We asked can she come back then.  The correct response would be - Sure, I'll take your order now and put it in at 5.  Well, she didn't and she never returned.
We then sent a text to concierge asking if we can order.  They responded they will send someone over.  A cabana attendant arrived, who had helped us in the morning and was pleasant then.  Well come the evening hours she wasn't as pleasant.  We were clearly an inconvenience now and you can read it all over her face.  She took our order and   went back to inform the manager that I was sitting on a chair in front of another cabana.  Our cabanas were the only ones being occupied.  The remaining cabanas were zipped up and the chairs were stripped of their cushions.  My location of the chair I was sitting on was in the sun with no shade so I sat on one of the unused cabana chairs to get out of the sun.  Again,  the chair was not going to be used by anyone as the cabana was zipped up.  I didn't see this to be an issue, but it was.
Robert let us know, I can not sit there even though the cabanas are not being used or we will charged for a third cabana.  He also let us know that they are understaffed and at capacity.  Which has nothing to do with sitting on an unused chair.  My brother asked him, so you are taking it out on us because you are understaffed.  His response was yes.  Very bizarre behavior from any employee, let alone management.  We asked if we can speak to someone else because he wasn't interested in dealing with us and made it very clear verbally.  He said there is no one else, he's the main person in charge.  After more complaints to the front desk about how rudely we have been treated, they finally sent over the food and beverage director Jason.  Jason was very professional, listened and even offered passes for our next visit.  We declined, but appreciated the nice gesture.  We weren't looking for compensation, just good old fashion customer service.

This is NOT a 5 star luxury spa resort.  If you are looking to enjoy a day of relaxation, pampering and great customer service - this is not the place for you.  

Check in -
We rented 2 cabanas for the day.  At check in we received an unwelcoming greeting from Robert.  Who happens to be the manager on duty.  He let us know what we can not do and that those without wristbands will NOT be served and can not step foot into the cabana.  He also let us know that we were parked in the wrong cabana parking spot and needed to move our car.  We retrieved the reservation showing him which cabanas we reserved and we were parked in the correct spot.  He brushed us off and sent us on our way.

Some of the showers and restrooms were not kept and being that the place was crowded the cleaning service needs to upkeep these places to continue to instill a sense of still being at a spa and to keep the image of luxury which HIGH END SPA failed to deliver.

The heat of the Day negated the need for a HIGH END SPA robe but nothing was offered up by the Spa as a replacement comp so there was a shortfall in satisfaction in my upgraded purchase with the Passport to Wellness Plus package.

The quartz massage was amazing and the facial although felt amazing didn't last long afterwards since there was still other activities to do that countered the benefits of the treatment. I would recommend having your a facial before a massage and closer to the tail end of your day.

There were not enough Keto friendly menu options at both the Cafe or Kitchen. So I was very limited as to what I was able to eat and the price points for the food cost more than you would expect for the size portions you receive so the food value was really not there for me either.

Been going here for over 27 years. I've seen all the growth and change. It's been bumpy and they are ironing out the kinks. Love the new bar - prob could use another one on other end of spa. I understand they are talking expansion though and even building a resort. I only hope it doesn't take away the private feel of this place. The area inside Starbucks (long hallway) seems like wasted space. Hardly anyone in there. Food was good, try the fish tacos (although I think they told me shells were gluten free and I'm certain they are not) and so were the beverages. Overall a relaxing day and I'd recommend if you want to get away. Get there early to claim a spot- it can get crowded and they do hit max occupancy on holidays and some weekends. Get on email list to purchase gift card deals when they offer them- it's definitely the way to go and they don't expire I'm told.

I was excited to spend the day at HIGH END SPA and expected to hear Warm water greetings of ""Good morning, thank you for choosing HIGH END SPA, on behalf of our staff, we hope you enjoy your day here.""

That greeting was never heard, ever. I initially reserved and paid for the BambooCabana for I tried to explain to Robert the email exchanges of what was told to me, but he was not going to hear anything I said. He stated that the email had to go through him and he had to approve everything and was not informed. So, HIGH END SPA's miscommunication  was misdirected towards me and my group.

Robert also said that we were placed in another poolside cabana and I had to move my car. I corrected him by showing my email confirmation and instead of apologizing for any confusion, he brushed it off. He was smug the entire time I was trying to explain what I understood. It didn't matter to him because he is the manager is always right, and customers are not and should be told so.

We shook it off and the day went by fine, as Asia and Jasson took care of us in a friendly and professional fashion. We all appreciated their attentiveness when they were around.

Imagine planning a family event for the last three months only to be greeted by list of restrictions upon restrictions. I was excited to spend the day at HIGH END SPA and expected to hear Warm water greetings of ""Good morning, thank you for choosing HIGH END SPA, on behalf of our staff, we hope you enjoy your day here.""

That greeting was never heard, ever. I initially reserved and paid for the BambooCabana for 8-10ppl @($400/day). Unfortunately HIGH END SPA couldn't get that for us because we changed dates but asked if we wanted 2 poolside cabana ($200/per cabana= same cost).  Totally fine .. just as long we can be together. I was totally upfront with the guest list indicating all guest-- not trying to cheat the system at all. Well, upon arriving we were told that we can't do a lot of things ""we won't serve people in your party who that exceeds the cabanas (4ppl) and you can't step into the cabana area"".

I tried to explain to Robert the email exchanges of what was told to me, but he was not going to hear anything I said. He stated that the email had to go through him and he had to approve everything and was not informed. So, HIGH END SPA's miscommunication  was misdirected towards me and my group.

Robert also said that we were placed in another poolside cabana and I had to move my car. I corrected him by showing my email confirmation and instead of apologizing for any confusion, he brushed it off. He was smug the entire time I was trying to explain what I understood. It didn't matter to him because he is the manager is always right, and customers are not and should be told so.

We shook it off and the day went by fine, as Asia and Jasson took care of us in a friendly and professional fashion. We all appreciated their attentiveness when they were around. We also ordered food from the cafeteria and several bars in the resort (as we didn't expect a personal attendant at all times). The group spend most of the time lounging in different pools so cabanas were used only as a quick stop to eat, drink and getting out of the sun.

At 5pm, a lot of people left and the day was getting quieter. We wanted to try the evening menu and ordered from a different server My, who proceeded to count heads in the cabana. We were told that we couldn't sit on an empty lounge chair in front of the 3rd cabana (that was mistakenly assigned to us earlier in the day--no one ever showed up/ it was zipped closed). My sister was told that she couldn't even sit on the edge of a lounge chair just to get out of the sun. The whole area was EMPTY. Are you kidding?! Robert came out reading the riot act saying that he could charge me another $200 for the day because my sister was sitting on the edge of the lounge chair in an area that was EMPTY. He reminded me that he had all our cards on file and that he could call security to have us removed.

We were not noisy, we didn't play music, we didn't bring outside food or alcohol, we didn't use foul language, we weren't inappropriately dressed. We were just sitting on the edge of a lounge chair. I asked Robert ""where's the demarcation between cabana and cabana and non cabana, if there was an actual border and lines to be crossed"" He informed me that there wasn't . But again, he threatened that he can charge me $200 for sitting on the EDGE of a lounge chair in an area that was EMPTY. He reiterated that several times.

What was suppose to be a celebration of family and a relaxing day ended up being a huge disappointment. Instead of fond memories of our family day in the mud, it's scarred by Robert's smugness and militant demeanor.  

We asked to speak to someone other than Robert, he told us that there was ""no one higher up"" than he; however Jason came out to LISTEN. He didn't blame anyone, he just listen and agreed that things could have turned out different and positively.

HIGH END SPA, you got a good thing going. I loved the place, the sense of peace and relaxation. I've been going there for 25+ years.. always a good experience.  Food is delicious and reasonably priced, atmosphere and landscape upkeep still lush and beautiful with great improvement and expansions. Belle and Nisha in the front, thank you for making us feel welcomed.

I made the mistake of going back again a week ago after I was unhappy with the service over a year ago, but I needed an adjustment. 1st time in I needed an adjustment, but all they wanted to do was a consultation, electrode pack, and get me out, but not before scheduling 12 appts. WTH? I argued I need to be adjusted, and apologized if I was an inconvenience but hell it's my money I'm spending. Reluctantly I was given a time to return that afternoon and what I got was a lay down on your stomach crack, and a bear hug crunch against the table. Then ok you're good to go. I then asked about checking my shoulders, pelvis etc... Again an inconvenience it seemed. Left regretting going in the 1st place, but we all use YELP and the reviews were good. Flash forward a year and I haven't needed chiropractic service so I again searched YELP when I needed help. Everything was booked so here I go again. Convenience was a key since i live within 5 minutes so I tried again. Same thing he read the note I wrote on a paper they gave me. From the time I left the waiting room to adjustment to walking back down the hall was 3-5 minutes tops. Same 2 adjustments without any further questioning. Then placed on the electrode pads. When I asked why it was explained it would loosen up my muscles. I then told them it was doing nothing to the area that brought me in the 1st place. Well lets crank it up to the max setting and wait and see. After that doing nothing I was placed on a roller bed that again did nothing for the area I was having pain. 1/2 way through I got up, paid, and left for the last time. Maybe I'm out of the realm for standard correcting if that's what's being done at this office. I wouldn't think so since 99% of the time I have 0 issues. I'll never go again, but what I would offer to them as advice is try not to make people feel like herded cattle being pushed through so you can make you next dollar.

I miss the old HIGH END SPA. I've waited 2 days to actually talk to someone there about purchasing a large gift certificate. I was going to buy online but have a question. No live chat available and no response to my email after 2 days. Tried calling - waited over 15 minutes on hold then gave up and used the call back option. When Melissa from HIGH END SPA called back, we didn't have the best connection and within seconds she hung up and didn't try me back. Been going here for over 25 years and I've watched the service of this place plummet. It will no longer be my annual girls trip and mother daughter trip. Not worth the hassle when there are many other spas with amazing service around So Cal. I'd rather pay more and have my day feel like a spa day than chase down someone for a drink and wait 30 minutes or deal with people on the phone who have bad attitudes. Good bye HIGH END SPA.

I've been coming here for over 25 years and have seen the ups and downs of this place. They are under with new management or ownership than last year when I came and so far it's better than before. This place is like an oasis away from it all. Mineral springs, wading/lounge pool, multiple hot tubs and spa treatments await you here. They serve alcohol and even put in a Starbucks. It's clean, and the locker room has you covered for shampoo, conditioner and lotion if you forget.

The weekends are my least favorite time to visit because it's just too crowded. Good luck getting a pool float and you'll wait nearly 30 minutes or more to get a drink. They reach maximum occupancy most weekends. They've done better dealing with the quantity of people but it's sill a long wait for most anything. Because of this. It's also hard to justify the cost to visit - $69 admission fee. The admission fee is just ridiculous. And if you don't book a $100 service like a massage or facial, , you're not guaranteed to get in. This is probably my last trip unless they have some super sensational deal. The drive coupled with no guarantees of getting in are a no win for me.

Another fabulous trip to HIGH END SPA! Love the new addition in the back with rocking chairs under beautiful trees! This place is growing faster than it can hardly keep up with - went on a Monday thinking it won't be as crowded and wow! It felt like a weekend! I'm hoping they will expand kitchen and help as it takes about 40 minutes to wait in line around the lunch hour to get food. It's all prepared fresh though and I appreciate that.

Been going here for over 27 years. I've seen all the growth and change. It's been bumpy and they are ironing out the kinks. Love the new bar - prob could use another one on other end of spa. I understand they are talking expansion though and even building a resort. I only hope it doesn't take away the private feel of this place. The area inside Starbucks (long hallway) seems like wasted space. Hardly anyone in there. Food was good, try the fish tacos (although I think they told me shells were gluten free and I'm certain they are not) and so were the beverages. Overall a relaxing day and I'd recommend if you want to get away. Get there early to claim a spot- it can get crowded and they do hit max occupancy on holidays and some weekends. Get on email list to purchase gift card deals when they offer them- it's definitely the way to go and they don't expire I'm told.

Imagine planning a family event for the last three months only to be greeted by list of restrictions upon restrictions. I was excited to spend the day at HIGH END SPA and expected to hear Warm water greetings of ""Good morning, thank you for choosing HIGH END SPA, on behalf of our staff, we hope you enjoy your day here.""

That greeting was never heard, ever. I initially reserved and paid for the BambooCabana for 8-10ppl @($400/day). Unfortunately HIGH END SPA couldn't get that for us because we changed dates but asked if we wanted 2 poolside cabana ($200/per cabana= same cost).  Totally fine .. just as long we can be together. I was totally upfront with the guest list indicating all guest-- not trying to cheat the system at all. Well, upon arriving we were told that we can't do a lot of things ""we won't serve people in your party that exceeds the cabanas (4ppl) and you can't step into the cabana area"".

I tried to explain to Robert the email exchanges of what was told to me, but he was not going to hear anything I said.

We also ordered food from the cafeteria and several bars in the resort (as we didn't expect a personal attendant at all times). The group spend most of the time lounging in different pools so cabanas were used only as a quick stop to eat, drink and getting out of the sun.

At 5pm, a lot of people left and the day was getting quieter. We wanted to try the evening menu and ordered from a different server My, who proceeded to count heads in the cabana. We were told that we couldn't sit on an empty lounge chair in front of the 3rd cabana (that was mistakenly assigned to us earlier in the day--no one ever showed up/ it was zipped closed). My sister was told that she couldn't even sit on the edge of a lounge chair just to get out of the sun. The whole area was EMPTY. Are you kidding?! Robert came out reading the riot act saying that he could charge me another $200 for the day because my sister was sitting on the edge of the lounge chair in an area that was EMPTY. He reminded me that he had all our cards on file and that he could call security to have us removed.

We were not noisy, we didn't play music, we didn't bring outside food or alcohol, we didn't use foul language, we weren't inappropriately dressed. We were just sitting on the edge of a lounge chair.

HIGH END SPA, you got a good thing going. I loved the place, the sense of peace and relaxation. I've been going there for 25+ years.. always a good experience.  Food is delicious and reasonably priced, atmosphere and landscape upkeep still lush and beautiful with great improvement and expansions. Belle and Nisha in the front, thank you for making us feel welcomed.

I'll start with the Pro since it's short. The Club Mud was cool.

The rest are cons. Remember that I'm here on a weekday in the off season.
- the grotto is $30 extra
- crap nachos to share are $30, drinks $15/drink and are pre mixed, weak
- the mineral baths are very small and are absolutely packed (again, on the off-season, on a weekday)
- the mini pools were all super packed by 11am as well
- we were told to make a reservation and pre pay so we did. Guess what, you wait in line anyway! The line is akin to a Vegas nightclub. They even section off the line and ""allow"" people to check in only as they see others leave. It's insane.
- after you check in you go to the bathhouse and change, which is so inefficiently setup all the girls flow in and out of the same tiny doorway. Non stop traffic jam.
- you then are told to put a credit card of file for drinks. Fine. But then they tell you to go to yet another location, carrying your DL, to get a wristband to go to yet another location to actually get a drink. All while having to carry your drivers license around a water park. So stupid. All this could be solved at checkin checking IDs and giving wrist bands.

It was my friends birthday today and she received ary admission for the day :) it was a rainy day at the spa but that did not take away from the experience at all. If anything, it made us appreciate all the hot pools even more :) I'm gonna break it down as simply as I can:

Had an amazing massage by Ricardo: +1!
Margaritas are strong and seemingly bottomless: +1!
Food at the main restaurant was yummy: +1!
The floating bean bags in the lounging pool! Omg that was the best. You can totally set your drinks on the floating loungers too and they won't sink: +1!
Free parking: +The biggest negative that sort of put a slight damper to my day was my run in with a security guard first thing in the morning when I got there.

Some backstory:
So I always back in to whatever spot I'm parking in unless there are signs in the lot that say ""head in only""

There are no such signs at HIGH END SPAn , so I went ahead and did my thing

The security guy walks literal circles around my car and gives me the eye and looks me over

Then he stopped in front of me and asks ""why are you parked like that????""

Mind you, there are cars all over the lot that are parked head in, head out, all sorts of directions. But he singled me out and is like ""you can't park like this. It's wrong. And it isn't allowed.""

I kindly mentioned that there aren't any signs advising against how I parked and pointed at another car parked like mine and asked him, ""you mean that guy can't park like that either then right? Because he backed into his spot too.""

He looked at the cars and was like ""no no, they are okay. That is fine but you cannot park like this. Fix it""

....that was a bit disappointing tbh. So for that unfortunate run in, I'd have to subtract a star. I've included photos of how other cars were parked

Been going here for over 27 years. I've seen all the growth and change. It's been bumpy and they are ironing out the kinks. Love the new bar - prob could use another one on other end of spa. I understand they are talking expansion though and even building a resort. I only hope it doesn't take away the private feel of this place. The area inside Starbucks (long hallway) seems like wasted space. Hardly anyone in there. Food was good, try the fish tacos (although I think they told me shells were gluten free and I'm certain they are not) and so were the beverages. Overall a relaxing day and I'd recommend if you want to get away. Get there early to claim a spot- it can get crowded and they do hit max occupancy on holidays and some weekends. Get on email list to purchase gift card deals when they offer them- it's definitely the way to go and they don't expire I'm told.

That greeting was never heard, ever. I initially reserved and paid for the BambooCabana for 8-10ppl @($400/day). Unfortunately HIGH END SPA couldn't get that for us because we changed dates but asked if we wanted 2 poolside cabana ($200/per cabana= same cost).  Totally fine .. just as long we can be together. I was totally upfront with the guest list indicating all guest-- not trying to cheat the system at all.

We were told that we couldn't sit on an empty lounge chair in front of the 3rd cabana (that was mistakenly assigned to us earlier in the day--no one ever showed up/ it was zipped closed).

Robert came out reading the riot act saying that he could charge me another $200 for the day because my sister was sitting on the edge of the lounge chair in an area that was EMPTY.

But then they tell you to go to yet another location, carrying your DL, to get a wristband to go to yet another location to actually get a drink. All while having to carry your drivers license around a water park. So stupid. All this could be solved at checkin checking IDs and giving wrist bands.
- overall the entire thing is akin to a water park. Maps everywhere. Extremely loud and packed. Nowhere to relax and unwind.

Pretty decent spa and a worthwhile experience. Though beautiful and cleanly, with excellent service, this spa contains a few drawbacks. The biggest being how crowded it was, even for a weekday.

I miss the old HIGH END SPA. I've waited 2 days to actually talk to someone there about purchasing a large gift certificate. I was going to buy online but have a question. No live chat available and no response to my email after 2 days. Tried calling - waited over 15 minutes on hold then gave up and used the call back option. When Melissa from HIGH END SPA called back, we didn't have the best connection and within seconds she hung up and didn't try me back. Been going here for over 25 years and I've watched the service of this place plummet. It will no longer be my annual girls trip and mother daughter trip. Not worth the hassle when there are many other spas with amazing service around So Cal.

I've been coming here for over 25 years and have seen the ups and downs of this place. They are under with new management or ownership than last year when I came and so far it's better than before. This place is like an oasis away from it all. Mineral springs, wading/lounge pool, multiple hot tubs and spa treatments await you here. They serve alcohol and even put in a Starbucks. It's clean, and the locker room has you covered for shampoo, conditioner and lotion if you forget.

The weekends are my least favorite time to visit because it's just too crowded. Good luck getting a pool float and you'll wait nearly 30 minutes or more to get a drink. They reach maximum occupancy most weekends. They've done better dealing with the quantity of people but it's sill a long wait for most anything. Because of this. It's also hard to justify the cost to visit - $69 admission fee. The admission fee is just ridiculous. And if you don't book a $100 service like a massage or facial, , you're not guaranteed to get in. This is probably my last trip unless they have some super sensational deal. The drive coupled with no guarantees of getting in are a no win for me.

Another fabulous trip to HIGH END SPA! Love the new addition in the back with rocking chairs under beautiful trees! This place is growing faster than it can hardly keep up with - went on a Monday thinking it won't be as crowded and wow! It felt like a weekend! I'm hoping they will expand kitchen and help as it takes about 40 minutes to wait in line around the lunch hour to get food. It's all prepared fresh though and I appreciate that.

Been going here for over 27 years. I've seen all the growth and change. It's been bumpy and they are ironing out the kinks. Love the new bar - prob could use another one on other end of spa. I understand they are talking expansion though and even building a resort. I only hope it doesn't take away the private feel of this place. The area inside Starbucks (long hallway) seems like wasted space. Hardly anyone in there. Food was good, try the fish tacos (although I think they told me shells were gluten free and I'm certain they are not) and so were the beverages. Overall a relaxing day and I'd recommend if you want to get away. Get there early to claim a spot- it can get crowded and they do hit max occupancy on holidays and some weekends. Get on email list to purchase gift card deals when they offer them- it's definitely the way to go and they don't expire I'm told.

I miss the old HIGH END SPA. I've waited 2 days to actually talk to someone there about purchasing a large gift certificate. I was going to buy online but have a question. No live chat available and no response to my email after 2 days. Tried calling - waited over 15 minutes on hold then gave up and used the call back option. When Melissa from HIGH END SPA called back, we didn't have the best connection and within seconds she hung up and didn't try me back. Been going here for over 25 years and I've watched the service of this place plummet. It will no longer be my annual girls trip and mother daughter trip. Not worth the hassle when there are many other spas with amazing service around So Cal. I'd rather pay more and have my day feel like a spa day than chase down someone for a drink and wait 30 minutes or deal with people on the phone who have bad attitudes. Good bye HIGH END SPA.

I miss the old HIGH END SPA. I've waited 2 days to actually talk to someone there about purchasing a large gift certificate. I was going to buy online but have a question. No live chat available and no response to my email after 2 days. Tried calling - waited over 15 minutes on hold then gave up and used the call back option. When Melissa from HIGH END SPA called back, we didn't have the best connection and within seconds she hung up and didn't try me back. Been going here for over 25 years and I've watched the service of this place plummet. It will no longer be my annual girls trip and mother daughter trip. Not worth the hassle when there are many other spas with amazing service around So Cal. I'd rather pay more and have my day feel like a spa day than chase down someone for a drink and wait 30 minutes or deal with people on the phone who have bad attitudes. Good bye HIGH END SPA.

I've been coming here for over 25 years and have seen the ups and downs of this place. They are under with new management or ownership than last year when I came and so far it's better than before. This place is like an oasis away from it all. Mineral springs, wading/lounge pool, multiple hot tubs and spa treatments await you here. They serve alcohol and even put in a Starbucks. It's clean, and the locker room has you covered for shampoo, conditioner and lotion if you forget.

The weekends are my least favorite time to visit because it's just too crowded. Good luck getting a pool float and you'll wait nearly 30 minutes or more to get a drink. They reach maximum occupancy most weekends. They've done better dealing with the quantity of people but it's sill a long wait for most anything. Because of this. It's also hard to justify the cost to visit - $69 admission fee. The admission fee is just ridiculous. And if you don't book a $100 service like a massage or facial, , you're not guaranteed to get in. This is probably my last trip unless they have some super sensational deal. The drive coupled with no guarantees of getting in are a no win for me.

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!

For our wedding anniversary, my parents purchased a pamper package from this establishment. We woke up early on our anniversary day, and drove three hours to make an 11am scheduled massage. When we got there the check in clerk couldnt find our reservation. The manager got involved and reviewed the recordings of the telephone conversation and states that the call was dropped and the reservation was not finalized. Our family had mentioned to us that when they asked for an email confirmation, they were told that the confirmation number provided over the phone would be sufficient to locating the appointment for the massage.

After back and forward with the manager he offer a 6:30pm slot.. 7HOURS after the original time. We got our money refunded and drove home for another 3hrs... what an anniversary!!

I visited HIGH END SPA last Thursday and I loved it! I drove in from L.A. and stayed from about 9am-7pm. There wasn't too long of a line when I got there and it went fast (security checks bags as you walk in). I would recommend bringing a dark colored swimsuit or one you wouldn't mind getting dirty (as the mud can do that), a cover-up/sweater for in between pools or for when it gets colder toward evening, a hairbrush if you plan to shower there (they provide combs but they are very flimsy), hairbands, a waterproof phone case or Ziploc bag for your phone, flip-flops, and an empty water bottle.

I learned about HIGH END SPA from a Vlog I watched and it was perfect for my stress-free day away from the busy city. My friend and I originally wanted to book the Wellness Package to get admission, the Grotto experience and a massage but when I called (and was on hold for a looong time) they said they were fully booked for the next few days so if you want a treatment, plan ahead! We ended up just buying the admission (teachers get 10% off) and the Grotto experience ($30). I recommend doing both if you don't get the package deal!!

My friend and I first reserved 2 lounge chairs by the lounging, shallow pool (the better lounge chairs get taken fast fyi) which has great beanbag chairs and rafts in it. You can drink, eat, read or just float away under the palm trees. We lounged in the sun, ate lunch and then I did an aqua-fitness class plus some laps in the lap pool. We went in the mineral Jacuzzi (which smells so bad but is supposed to be good for opening up your pores), the cold/hot experience pools, club mud (fun!) and finally the Grotto. Ask the workers when you check-in in what order to do things and they'll advise you (shout-out to Will who was great!!!). It wasn't too crowded when I was there but I'd definitely recommend coming on a weekday if you can as I can see how much more pleasant it is when it's not as crowded! There are lockers for your things so you can leave stuff in there all day and just tie the key on your swimsuit.

Considering any place else is quite silly!

I had a lower-back problem for years (started when I was in 7th grade)! I went to every sort of doctor/specialist under the sun, and I am sure you can guess the results. I was given pain pills and told there was nothing that could be done. DOCTOR fixed it! No pills. No bull. He took some x-rays, asked some questions, did some physical testing, and was able to discover what was wrong and correct it. I went from always walking around with at least a dull pain in my lower-back (even with taking pain pills) to having absolutely no pain, and I haven't even had an adjustment in months and months!

This office is a great place if you have an appreciation for chiropractic care. The staff is so caring and attentive and the atmosphere is very soothing. Both doctors do a great job. I wish they'd do a full adjustment of the body without me having to ask, but they do focus on your ailments and make sure your treatments are tailored to you.

Additionally, the have some great spa services. The massage therapist, Juliard, does a great job with my sports oriented deep massages.

They work at a spa! Hahaha a little too laid back, if that makes sense. Anyway, still great service.

My husband and i started coming here for neck, shoulders and back relief.  We're new parents and carrying a baby around all day every day starts to cause a build up of knots.  We've tried different therapists and have enjoyed them all.  The two we usually see are Julliard and Autumn, but all have been great.

The chiropractors are also very patient and kind. I've never had an adjustment before coming here so Dr. Ramisar (sorry if mispelled) took the time to explain what he was going to do and patiently instructed me on how to position myself for the adjustment. It made the experience much more comfortable for me, a newbie to Chiropractice care.

I just enjoyed an hour neck and shoulder massage yesterday morning with Julliard and it was a little painful, not going to lie... But thats because of my really bad knots.  Afterwards, i felt like a million bucks. I was literally singing and skipping around taking care of errands like i just won a billion bucks.

And before you say $35/hr is too much, that you'd rather get a $10 massage at the mall... Really think about it first.  1) consider this a treatment and not a back rub - why wouldnt u want a licensed professional, in a clean clinical setting. And 2) check ur insurance Chiro plan - $10 copay, then Kaiser covers the massage if I get an adjustment the same day! =))","mostRecentVisit_rating",5,"no",NA,"5/25/2016

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!

For our wedding anniversary, my parents purchased a pamper package from this establishment. We woke up early on our anniversary day, and drove three hours to make an 11am scheduled massage. When we got there the check in clerk couldnt find our reservation. The manager got involved and reviewed the recordings of the telephone conversation and states that the call was dropped and the reservation was not finalized. Our family had mentioned to us that when they asked for an email confirmation, they were told that the confirmation number provided over the phone would be sufficient to locating the appointment for the massage.

After back and forward with the manager he offer a 6:30pm slot.. 7HOURS after the original time. We got our money refunded and drove home for another 3hrs... what an anniversary!!
